The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) introduced a new temporary flat rate method to simplify the process of claiming the deduction for home office expenses for the 2020 tax year. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows Taxpayers to deduct business-use-of-home (self-employed) or workspace-in-the-home (employee) expenses from your income which lower the amount of taxable income being claimed, which reduces the overall tax burden. 2.33 To the extent that telephone and internet service at an individual’s home is used for both business and personal purposes, only the business portion of the expense will be deductible.
