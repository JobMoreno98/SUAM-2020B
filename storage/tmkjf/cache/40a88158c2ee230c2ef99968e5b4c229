In 2018, Greensill Capital won the contract to run it. | Greensil April 15, 2021 T He focuses on David Cameron’s role in lobbying for Greenship Capital’s involvement in the NHS payment system, which has obscured a less glamorous question: how a firm so important in such a mundane part of the financial services ecology happened? Greensill Capital’s recent problems have highlighted the many different products and industries that were somehow featured in its structures. But Boris Johnson has said ministers should get MPs to "mark their own homework" and his internal probe will get to the bottom of the matter. Meet Lex Greensill.
