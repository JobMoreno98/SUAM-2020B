This edition published in 1973 by Bradbury Press in Scarsdale, N.Y. Jessie Bollinger has been kidnapped and is forced to make the dangerous voyage across the Atlantic to bring back slaves from Africa. Set during the middle of the nineteenth century, when the illegal slave trade was at its height, The Slave Dancer not only tells a vivid and shocking story of adventure and survival, but depicts the brutality of slavery with unflinching historical accuracy. When they get to Africa they travel the coast and the captain uses a small boat to go and meet with the African chiefs who are selling people into slavery.
