[169][170] In the early 20th century, Constantin Rădulescu-Codin, a teacher in Muscel County where the castle was situated,[170] published a local legend about Vlad's letter of grant "written on rabbit skin" for the villagers who had helped him to escape from Poenari Castle to Transylvania during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia. [62][63] Vlad styled himself "Lord and ruler over all of Wallachia, and the duchies of Amlaș and Făgăraș" on 20 September 1459, showing that he had taken possession of both of these traditional Transylvanian fiefs of the rulers of Wallachia. With Murad’s help, Vlad III ascended to Wallachia’s throne sometime between October and November 1448. [124] Báthory's forces captured Târgoviște on 8 November. [143] Münster also recorded Vlad's "reputation for tyrannical justice".[143]. [120] Corvinus dispatched Vlad and the Serbian Vuk Grgurević to fight against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. Up … Nor were these people enough; he became even more evil and gathered 300 boys from Brașov and Țara Bârsei that he found in ... Wallachia. 500–1500. The sultan's army entered into the area of the impalements, which was seventeen stades long and seven stades wide. The boys were taken to the various garrisons at Edirne. [169] The chronicle added that Vlad forced the young boyars and their wives and children to build the Poenari Castle. There were large stakes there on which, as it was said, about twenty thousand men, women, and children had been spitted, quite a sight for the Turks and the sultan himself. [32][34], We bring you news that [Nicholas Vízaknai] writes to us and asks us to be so kind as to come to him until [John Hunyadi] ... returns from the war. There were infants too affixed to their mothers on the stakes, and birds had made their nests in their entrails. On 16 and 17 June, he again defeated a sizable Ottoman force in what has become known as The Night Attack, which resulted in heavy casualties to the Ottoman army, as well as logistical losses. Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars to strengthen his position. After Mehmed II suffered losses from The Night Attack, Radu and his loyalists campaigned on the Danubian plains for support to replace his brother. [112] He associates the author of the forgery with a Saxon priest of Brașov. While he was a child, the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund died, and the senior Vlad worked on policies of neutrality with the Turks, feeling it was necessary to do this to protect the interests of Wallachia. On the other hand, the Skazanie sharply criticized Vlad for his conversion to Catholicism, attributing his death to this apostasy. [117] When a group of soldiers broke into the house while pursuing a thief who had tried to hide there, Vlad had their commander executed because they had not asked his permission before entering his home, according to the Slavic stories about his life. View Vlad Radu’s profile on LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional community. [29] The Byzantine historian Michael Critobulus wrote that Vlad and Radu fled to the Ottoman Empire, which suggests that the sultan had allowed them to return to Wallachia after their father paid homage to him. [179] He regarded Vlad as a reformer whose acts of violence were necessary to prevent the despotism of the boyars. [188] Stoker had his attention drawn to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore by Emily Gerard's article about Transylvanian superstitions (published in 1885). [29][18] Hunyadi made Vladislav II (son of Vlad Dracul's cousin, Dan II) the ruler of Wallachia. In 1462, a massive Ottoman army marched against Wallachia, with Radu at the head of the Janissary. [40] He must have returned to Hungary before 3 July 1456, because on that day Hunyadi informed the townspeople of Brașov that he had tasked Vlad with the defence of the Transylvanian border. [95] During the night of 16–17 June, Vlad broke into the Ottoman camp in an attempt to capture or kill the sultan. [5] He himself signed his two letters as "Dragulya" or "Drakulya" in the late 1470s. In 1436, Vlad II Dracul ascended the throne of Wallachia. [45] The lists of the members of the princely council during Vlad's reign also show that only two of them (Voico Dobrița and Iova) were able to retain their positions between 1457 and 1461. [174] For instance, the tales about the burning of the lazy, the poor, and the lame at Vlad's order and the execution of the woman who had made her husband too short a shirt can also be found among the German and Slavic anecdotes. In 1442 Vlad Dracul was asked by Sultan Murad the Great to present his homage and was imprisoned in Gallipoli fortress, while his sons Vlad and Radu („not of age” according to a Turkish chronicler) were sent to Egrigoz fortress in Anatolia. There were many battles between the two brothers, and even though Vlad defeated Radu several times, impaling over 30.000 Ottoman soldiers, Radu gained the support of the noblemen. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. The future Vlad III was sent along with Radu, his younger brother, to the Ottoman court as a hostage to ensure that his father stayed true to his word. Taking advantage of their fortune the Ottomans strengthened their commercial presence in the Danube against any Hungarian influence and intervention in the region.[6]. The rest of the Turks were dumbfounded when they saw the multitude of men on the stakes. The expression Dracula, which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of Vlad III. Despite winning a couple more victories against the Ottomans, Vlad was soon short of cash and sought the help of the Hungarians, or he was intercepted by them while retreating. [27] John Hunyadi (who had become the regent-governor of Hungary in 1446)[28] broke into Wallachia in November 1447. [42] In the same letter, he stated that "when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him",[44] showing his authoritarian personality. Childhood Vlad was born in Sighișoara, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (today part of Romania). His sobriquet Dracula (meaning “son of Dracul”) was derived from the Latin draco (“dragon”) after his father’s induction into the Order of the Dragon, created by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund for the defense of Christian Europe against the Ottoman Empire. His wife was Maria Despina, considered to be a Serb or Albanian princess. In November 1447, John Hunyadi launched an attack against Wallachia due to its alliance with the Ottomans by the treaties signed by Vlad II Dracul and his duplicity in Varna Campaign (1444). [80] Both records suggest that Vlad ignored the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, already in 1459, but both works were written decades after the events. Vlad III travelled to Hungary to ask for help from his former ally, Matthias Corvinus. [137] She survived Vlad Dracul, and first married Pál Suki, then János Erdélyi. Vlad III retreated to Transylvania. [21] The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, ordered him to come to Gallipoli to demonstrate his loyalty. [1], Matthias Corvinus recognized Vlad as the lawful prince of Wallachia, but he did not provide him military assistance to regain his principality. [189] His limited knowledge about the medieval history of Wallachia came from William Wilkinson's book entitled Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them, published in 1820. You know that King Matthias has sent me and when I came to Țara Bârsei the officials and councilors of Brașov and the old men of Țara Bârsei cried to us with broken hearts about the things which Dracula, our enemy, did; how he did not remain faithful to our Lord, the king, and had sided with the [Ottomans]. [14] The last of the four charters also referred to their younger brother, Radu. [194] Actually, Stoker's working papers for his book contain no references to the historical figure,[191] the name of the character being named in all draughts but the later ones 'Count Wampyr'. [114] Before long, he was taken to Visegrád, where he was held for fourteen years. Then he had the women's breasts cut off and put the babies inside headfirst; thus he had them impaled together. He was released at the request of Stephen III of Moldavia in the summer of 1475. Radu eventually became friends with Murad II's son, Mehmed II. [114] No documents referring to Vlad between 1462 and 1475 have been preserved. [59] Vlad referred to Michael Szilágyi as "his Lord and elder brother" in a letter on 1 December 1457. Vlad and his younger brother, Radu, were held as hostages in the Ottoman Empire in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. A short time after their father was captured and killed by the forces of John Hunyadi, Vlad III was released in 1448 and was the Ottoman Turks' candidate for the throne of Wallachia, the first of a succession of times he would hold the throne, this first time for only a matter of months. The approximate date of his death is between 1475 and 1477. [138][140] He was the forefather of the noble Drakwla family.  Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned. [167] Romanian defense minister Ioan Mircea Pașcu asserted that Vlad would have been condemned for crimes against humanity had he been put on trial at Nuremberg. [14] They were mentioned in four further documents between 1437 and 1439. [14], After a meeting with John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, Vlad II Dracul did not support an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania in March 1442. [10] Mircea the Shepherd, Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1 April 1551. Vlad has 2 jobs listed on their profile. [124] Vlad stayed in Brașov and confirmed the commercial privileges of the local burghers in Wallachia on 7 October 1476. [22][23] Vlad and Radu accompanied their father to the Ottoman Empire, where they were all imprisoned. [85][86], After the execution of the Ottoman officials, Vlad gave orders in fluent Turkish to the commander of the fortress of Giurgiu to open the gates, enabling the Wallachian soldiers to break in the fortress and capture it. [93][95] However, the Wallachians "missed the court of the sultan himself"[96] and attacked the tents of the viziers Mahmut Pasha and Isaac. [166], The mass murders that Vlad carried out indiscriminately and brutally would most likely amount to acts of genocide and war crimes by current standards. [4] His daughter was Maria Voichița, who later married Prince Stephen III of Moldavia. [159] The manuscripts were written in Russian, but they copied a text that had originally been recorded in a South Slavic language, because they contain expressions alien to the Russian language but used in South Slavic idioms (such as diavol for "evil"). Vlad III was born in Transylvania, a region adjacent to Wallachia in what is now Romania, in 1431. Like his older brother Mircea II, Vlad III was an able military commander and now found himself opposing the Ottomans. [16] Modern historians identify Vlad's mother either as a daughter or a kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia,[13][16][17] or as his father's unknown first wife. [7] His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul ("Vlad the Dragon" in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon. "Iar fratele lui mergea inaintea noastra" ("Călători străini despre Tările Române" Nicolae Iorga. [88], Having learnt of Vlad's invasion, Mehmed II raised an army of more than 150,000 strong, that was said to be "second in size only to the one"[89] that occupied Constantinople in 1453, according to Chalkokondyles. ), Enciclopedia bătăliilor din istoria românilor, Editura Meronia, Bucureşti, 2011, Stephen the Great and Balkan Nationalism: Moldova and Eastern European History. [60], Ladislaus Hunyadi's younger brother, Matthias Corvinus, was elected king of Hungary on 24 January 1458. Vlad III, most commonly known as Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad Țepeș [ˈvlad ˈtsepeʃ]) or Vlad Dracula (/ˈdrækjələ/; Romanian: Vlad Drăculea [ˈdrəkule̯a]; 1428/31 – 1476/77), was Voivode of Wallachia three times between 1448 and his death. [77] Peace had been restored before 26 July 1460, when Vlad addressed the burghers of Brașov as his "brothers and friends". [131] However, the excavations carried out by Dinu V. Rosetti in 1933 found no tomb below the supposed "unmarked tombstone" of Vlad in the monastery church. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad’s younger brother, Radu. ... Turkish messengers came to [Vlad] to pay respects, but refused to take off their turbans, according to their ancient custom, whereupon he strengthened their custom by nailing their turbans to their heads with three spikes, so that they could not take them off. Print Collector/Getty Images. While Vlad was exiled in Hungary, his younger brother Radu, who had sided with the Ottomans, sat on the throne of Wallachia. He had two older half-brothers, Mircea II and Vlad Călugărul, and a younger brother, Radu III the Handsome. [93][94] Outnumbered by the enemy, Vlad adopted a scorched earth policy and retreated towards Târgoviște. Vlad III, most commonly known as Vlad the Impaler   or Vlad Dracula (/ˈdrækjələ/; Romanian: Vlad Drăculea [ˈdrəkule̯a]; 1428/31 – 1476/77), was Voivode of Wallachia  three times between 1448 and his death. [74] Basarab had settled in Sighișoara and laid claim to Wallachia. [122] Stephen Báthory and Vlad entered Moldavia, forcing the sultan to lift the siege of the fortress at Târgu Neamț in late August, according to a letter of Matthias Corvinus. [69] Vlad's protectionist tendencies or border fairs are not documented. Vlad was held in captivity in Visegrád from 1463 to 1475. [87][88] He sought military assistance from Corvinus, declaring that he had broken the peace with the sultan "for the honor" of the king and the Holy Crown of Hungary and "for the preservation of Christianity and the strengthening of the Catholic faith". He invaded Wallachia on several occasions during Radu's reign, dethroning him four times in response to Radu's vassalage.[8]. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiotă (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Consequently, Stoker borrowed the name and "scraps of miscellaneous information" about the history of Wallachia when writing his book about Count Dracula. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad and Radu grew up in Sighișoara, but in 1436, the Dragon took the throne of Wallachia and the family moved to Târgoviște, the capital. [116] Vlad moved to Transylvania in June 1475. [147][148] Antonio Bonfini also recorded anecdotes about Vlad in his Historia Pannonica around 1495. See the complete profile on LinkedIn and discover Vlad… [53] Taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Vlad assisted Stephen, son of Bogdan II of Moldavia, in his move to seize Moldavia in June 1457. Radu Vlad is on Facebook. In 1462, Vlad was captured by Matthias I of Hungary. Join Facebook to connect with Radu Vlad and others you may know. There are more than twenty manuscripts (written between the 15th and 18th centuries)[158] which preserved the text of the Skazanie o Drakule voievode (The Tale about Voivode Dracula). The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe. [129] According to popular tradition (which was first recorded in the late 19th century),[130] Vlad was buried in the Monastery of Snagov. [30][31] Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October. "[130] Historian Constantin Rezachevici said Vlad was most probably buried in the first church of the Comana Monastery, which had been established by Vlad and was near the battlefield where he was killed. [92], The Ottoman fleet landed at Brăila (which was the only Wallachian port on the Danube) in May. [11], Vlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia. ... [Vlad] had a big copper cauldron built and put a lid made of wood with holes in it on top. His personal Janissary guard was larger than the entire army of Vlad III. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Brothers Dracul by Aftershock Comics revolves around teenage Vlad and his brother Radu while they were Ottoman prisoners and being taught how to hunt vampires. [5][6] Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula already in the 15th century. [87] He informed Matthias Corvinus about the military action in a letter on 11 February 1462. If he returns from the war we will meet him and we will make peace with him. [83][84] He also sent secret instructions to Hamza, bey of Nicopolis, to capture Vlad after he crossed the Danube. [29] Vlad Dracul and his eldest son, Mircea, were murdered. [150] Bonfini's stories about Vlad were repeated in Sebastian Münster's Cosmography. Radu Florescu dead: Legacy of the Romanian 'Dracula professor' remembered. [31] Vladislav II returned to Wallachia at the head of the remnants of his army. [168], The Cantacuzino Chronicle was the first Romanian historical work to record a tale about Vlad the Impaler, narrating the impalement of the old boyars of Târgoviște for the murder of his brother, Dan. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Rosetti reported: "Under the tombstone attributed to Vlad there was no tomb. [10] The Ottoman writer Tursun Beg referred to him as Kazıklı Voyvoda (Impaler Lord) around 1500. Radu chased Vlad III to his castle north of Curtea de Argeș and, finally, out of Romania itself, which was incorporated under Ottoman control. [68] According to a scholarly theory, the conflict emerged after Vlad forbade the Saxons to enter Wallachia, forcing them to sell their goods to Wallachian merchants at compulsory border fairs. [118] Corvinus ordered the burghers of Sibiu to give 200 golden florins to Vlad from the royal revenues on 21 September, but Vlad left Transylvania for Buda in October. [37][39] Vlad returned to Moldavia where Alexăndrel had dethroned Peter Aaron. [162][163] For instance, the Skazanie writes of a golden cup that nobody dared to steal at a fountain[164] because Vlad "hated stealing so violently ... that anybody who caused any evil or robbery ... did not live long", thereby promoting public order, and the German story about Vlad's campaign against Ottoman territory underlined his cruel acts while the Skazanie emphasized his successful diplomacy[165] calling him "zlomudry" or "evil-wise". Like his older brother Mircea II, Vlad III was an able military commander and now found himself opposing the Ottomans. [127] According to Leonardo Botta, the Milanese ambassador to Buda, the Ottomans cut Vlad's corpse into pieces. But above and beyond this, he preached of a lasting peace, a gentle reign, and no revenge for any past wrongdoings. [35][36] Not long after, he moved to Moldavia, where Bogdan II (his father's brother-in-law and possibly his maternal uncle) had mounted the throne with John Hunyadi's support in the autumn of 1449. [45] He began a purge against the boyars who had participated in the murder of his father and elder brother, or whom he suspected of plotting against him. You must come, O dread Impaler, confound them to your care.Split them in two partitions, here the fools, the rascals there;Shove them into two enclosures from the broad daylight enisle 'em,Then set fire to the prison and the lunatic asylum. In 1473, following an agreement with the Ottomans, Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân (Basarab Laiotă the Old) took over the throne. [83][84] Mehmed sent his envoy, the Greek Thomas Katabolinos (also known as Yunus bey), to Wallachia, ordering Vlad to come to Constantinople. A short time after their father was captured and killed by the forces of John Hunyadi, Vlad III was released in 1448 and was the Ottoman Turks' candidate for the throne of Wallachi… [1], Mehmed II invaded Moldavia and defeated Stephen III in the Battle of Valea Albă on 26 July 1476. When his sons were taken, Dracul had unsuccessfully attempted to bargain with the Turks for their release. Dan III broke into Wallachia, but Vlad defeated and executed him before 22 April 1460. [48] After John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, his elder son, Ladislaus Hunyadi became the captain-general of Hungary. After consulting his astrologers, the thirty-year-old sultan resolved to personally lead the punitive expedition. He was ousted in 1442 by rival factions in league with Hungary, but secured Ottoman support for his return by agreeing to pay tributeto the Sultan and also send his two legitimate sons, Vlad III and Radu, to the Ottoman court, to serve as hostages of his loyalty. Soon after, the Janissary under his command began attacks and raids on Vlad III's mountain stronghold on the Argeș River, Poenari Castle. [51] The latter (identified as Vlad's illegitimate brother, Vlad the Monk)[42][52] took possession of Amlaș, which had customarily been held by the rulers of Wallachia in Transylvania. [112] Most historians agree that the documents were forged to give grounds for Vlad's imprisonment. [42] He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia. [144] Beheim also accused Vlad of duplicity, stating that Vlad had promised support to both Matthias Corvinus and Mehmed II but did not keep the promise. ... [H]e captured all the merchants of Brașov and Țara Bârsei who had gone in peace to Wallachia and took all their wealth; but he was not satisfied only with the wealth of these people, but he imprisoned them and impaled them, 41 in all. [169] The legend of the Poenari Castle was mentioned in 1747 by Neofit I, Metropolitan of Ungro–Wallachia, who complemented it with the story of Meșterul Manole, who allegedly walled in his bride to prevent the crumbling of the walls of the castle during the building project. Vlad II was to betray this oath however, and come to an agreement with the Turks in return for retaining his throne and in 1436 as insurance of his fidelity he handed over his two sons Vlad and his younger brother Radu to the Sultan Murad II as hostages. [196] The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip. [110][112] Corvinus's court historian, Antonio Bonfini, admitted that the reason for Vlad's imprisonment was never clarified. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. [124] Stephen of Moldavia and Vlad ceremoniously confirmed their alliance, and they occupied Bucharest, forcing Basarab Laiotă to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire on 16 November. Radu's brother Vlad III later went on to take the throne from Vladislav II in 1456 and began his second reign for which he was to become famous. Vlad was the second of three sons; his brothers were Mircea and Radu. [13] As he was old enough to be a candidate to the throne of Wallachia in 1448, his time of birth would have been between 1428 and 1431. Radu's father fled, but Mircea II was captured by boyars  from Târgovișteand was blinded with a red-hot poker before being buried alive. [152][153] The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad's campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to Mehmed II's invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year. Vengeful Vlad vs. everyone. Between 1473 and 1475 Radu briefly returned twice to the throne. [171] In other villages of the region, the donation is attributed to the legendary Radu Negru. [14][13] Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429. Voivode of Wallachia, Beylerbeyi and Pasha of Wallachia. [105][106] Vlad withdrew to the Carpathian Mountains, hoping that Matthias Corvinus would help him regain his throne. [158] Almost half of the anecdotes emphasize, like the German stories, Vlad's brutality, but they also underline that his cruelty enabled him to strengthen the central government in Wallachia. But when Radu died in 1475, as Live Science explains, the boyars started feeling nostalgic for the good old impaley days and began campaigning for Vlad's … [29][18], Upon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia.
