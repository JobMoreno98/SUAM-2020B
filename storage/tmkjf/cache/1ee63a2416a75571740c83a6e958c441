MacDonald, Caesar's human assistant and the younger brother of MacDonald (from Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) reveals to Caesar that his brother told him of archived footage of Cornelius and Zira within the underground, now radioactive ruins of what is known as the Forbidden City from the last film. The scene where Cornelius is "shot" by a human boy begins slightly earlier, making it clear that the shooting is a game – which makes more sense, since no mutant party had yet even approached Ape City. Battle: Kolp Gets It (00:45) Music by Leonard Rosenman: 30. One scene takes place after Aldo chases teacher Abe, where MacDonald reminds him why humans should not say "no" to an ape.
