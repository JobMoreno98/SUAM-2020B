The World Before Her ‪2012‬ ‪Documentary‬ ‪1 h 29 min‬ ‪English audio‬ ‪CC‬ ‪PG‬ ‪77‬ Twenty young women from across India arrive for an intense, month-long beauty boot camp - they are the hand-picked contestants for the Miss India pageant. Meanwhile, just a few hours away, Prachi Trivedi works at a very different kind of camp – one run by a militant Hindu nationalist group, where young girls are trained to combat western influences.

When so much goes into making us who and what we are, do we not then have to question the very notion of freedom itself? Both girls are encouraged to pursue particular ideals by their parents. Are you up for the challenge? Ruhi doesn’t see the irony of being arrayed as so much pretty flesh or have a problem with hearing a judge, himself a former successful model, say: “ we need to see their bodies”. Nisha Pahuja ’s The World Before Her will make you uncomfortable, it will urge you to question what you know and believe, and it will shame you for being a part of a society that doesn’t fundamentally understand that men and women are equal; that such a question being raised itself is a mark of how undeserving humanity is of the world it inhabits.

The filmmaker is heard telling Prachi that she ( Prachi) is “fighting for a belief system that is actually trying to control (you)”. It reveals a world of startling contrasts between urban and rural, jeans and saris, consumer culture and poverty, where rapid economic development fuels a sharpening conflict between tradition and modernity--especially when it touches on women and religion. One is an English-speaking middle-class aspirant to the good life which she believes will be hers if only she can win a beauty crown. Prachi appears to be a confident woman and relishes her role as a camp leader, but she also reveals to Pahuja that her father beats her and she accepts it because ‘she is a girl’ and lucky to have been born. Her conviction in the tenets of Hindutva, of the kind she has been taught and she is now imparting to the girls attending the Durga Vahini camp, is absolute.
