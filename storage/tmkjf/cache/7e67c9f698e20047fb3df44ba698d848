Since joining from Athletic Bilbao in a then Bundesliga record deal, Martinez has won seven successive league titles, four German Cups and the 2013 Champions League. [61][62], On 21 August 2013, Schalke 04 played their first home match of the 2013–14 season, a UEFA Champions League qualifier at the Veltins-Arena against the Greek runners-up PAOK (led by former head coach Huub Stevens), drawing 1–1. From 1935 to 1939, they did not lose a single league match. [48][49] Against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Schalke conceded its fifth own goal of the season, yet another negative record. The club never lost a home match in the Gauliga Westfalen in all these 11 seasons and only lost six away matches, while remaining unbeaten in the 1935–36, 1936–37, 1937–38, 1938–39, 1940–41 and 1942–43 seasons, a sign of the club's dominance.[10]. [23] After finishing sixth in the 2014–15 season, the club announced the resignation of head coach Roberto Di Matteo on 26 May 2015. The facility was used for amateur matches during its later years with a reduced capacity of 5,000. [28] In the second half of the 2019–20 season, Schalke set a new club record of 16 league games without a win between 25 January and 27 June 2020. Lewandowski has reached ever greater heights at Bayern, scoring 288 goals in 326 matches Manuel Neuer was part of a Schalke team that reached the Champions League semi-finals Our fate has been sealed as a result of all our games this season, not just tonight. A number of finishes at the lower end of the league table followed, before a marked improvement in 1971–72, culminating in a second-place finish to Bayern Munich and after having led the league for much of the season. Before a match between both clubs, the official club songs are played. Also featured were prominent fans like Manfred Breuckmann, Ulrich Potofski or DJ Hooligan. Of the eight games they won in the first half of the season, six of them had Schalke taking the lead. [79], Other longstanding departments include the handball department, which was founded in 1926 and competed in the Gaumeister, Gauliga during the Third Reich, and the current top division. The 81-time USMNT international went on to enjoy great success at his next station in Kaiserslautern, where he won the DFB Cup in 1990 and the club's first Bundesliga title the following year. The separation proved short-lived and the two came together again in 1919 as Turn- und Sportverein Schalke 1877.

Stevens' contract was to run until 30 June 2013.[19]. January 15, 2021 amosandrewmurphy FC Schalke 04, Headlines 2. Within this period, they scored 924 goals and conceded just 145. Nos. Stevens, who was widely unknown in Germany at the time, quickly earned himself a cult following among the Schalke supporters. Partially, Schalke fielded up to ten young players with potential who played in the Schalke youth system throughout the season. Within two years, they slipped to 12th place. Fußballclub Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04 e. V., commonly known as FC Schalke 04 (German: [ɛf tseː ˈʃalkə nʊl fiːɐ̯]), Schalke 04, or abbreviated as S04 (German: [ˈɛs nʊl fiːɐ̯]), is a professional German football and multi-sports club originally from the Schalke district of Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. In the early 1980s, Die Knappen ran into trouble and found themselves relegated to the second division of the Bundesliga for the 1981–82 season and, after promotion, again in 1983–84. [citation needed] This figure makes Schalke 04 the second-biggest sports club in Germany and fourth-biggest sports club in the world, behind Bayern Munich, Sporting Lisbon and first-placed Benfica. They lost the inaugural Tschammerpokal 0–2 to 1. [61] Around 30 per cent of the members were not from North Rhine-Westphalia. The most dominant squad in the 1930s, Schalke earned its nickname from their royal blue kits. The new club won its first honours in 1923 as champions of the Schalke Kreisliga. [citation needed], In 1924, the football team parted ways with the gymnasts again, this time taking the club chairman along with them. Within just weeks of his appointment, Rangnick masterminded a 5–2 victory over Inter Milan at the San Siro during the quarter-finals of the Champions League. As of June 2018, the club has 155,000 members, making it the second-largest sports club in Germany[4] and the fourth-largest sports club in the world in terms of membership. Munich have just snapped up an academy graduate from their Bundesliga rivals in the form of Leroy Sane, who joins them via Manchester City Currently, the team competes in ProB. Since then the competition has been dominated by Bayern Munich which has taken the championship in 29 of the 57 Bundesliga seasons played to 2020. Despite having legendary status among Schalke supporters, Stevens' return to Schalke was met with some scepticism as fans feared that Stevens, who coached Schalke to the 1997 UEFA Cup win with a rigidly defensive system, could abandon Rangnick's system of attacking play in favour of returning to his 1997 defensive antics. [20] The doubts of the supporters proved unfounded. After a record 1,038 Bundesliga matches (669 as a coach, 369 as a player) the then-73-year-old Heynckes went out on top, as Bayern finished 21 points ahead of Schalke… The club's dominance throughout this period led them to be held up for propaganda purposes by the Nazi regime as an example of "new Germany". Despite their improved results, the seeds of a major reversal had already been sown. ): Matt Ford: "Bundesliga: Schalke relegated for first time in 30 years". Hennes Weisweiler, 1970. With Germany in chaos towards the end of World War II, Schalke played just two matches in 1945. On 2 March 2021, Dimitrios Grammozis was announced as new head coach for Schalke 04. Bayern Munich has won the title 30 times, the most among Bundesliga clubs. This league saw Schalke's most successful decade in their history: from 1933 to 1942, the club would appear in 14 of 18 national finals (ten in the German championship and eight in the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal) and win their league in every one of its eleven seasons.
