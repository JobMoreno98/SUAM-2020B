The Wailing - Movie review by film critic Tim Brayton I shall simply cut to the chase: The Wailing is all that I could possibly ask of a horror movie. The Wailing. If you don’t watch films with subtitles (for whatever reason) The Wailing is a reason to start. The drama. This is a real horror movie. The script is one insane rollercoaster of emotions. Recommendations cannot come high enough, for in every filmmaking department across the board - script, direction, sound, cinematography, editing - THE WAILING is weird and wildly winsome! ... With bewitching black-and-white cinematography and a … The intensity. Nothing gimmicky. Director, Hong-jin Na is now a 3 time winner at the game of making marvelous movies. “The Wailing” dodges the use of cheap thrills and jump scares and instead relies on atmospheric direction, beautiful cinematography, impeccable production/costume design and makeup, and stellar acting to achieve its visceral impact.

The Wailing is available in … A policeman, drawn into the incident, is forced to solve the mystery in order … Having lived in Korea for a while it really made me miss the countryside there. The performances from the cast are spot on, the camera work is majestic, and the storytelling is wonderfully mysterious. The wonderful cinematography and excellent use of various locations creates a pervasive feeling of uneasiness–something clearly deadly and evil is happening within this village, and the answers are not coming quickly enough. Amazing cinematography and art direction. After watching The Wailing for the first time, I had the impression that it was this kind of movie. As it happens, The Wailing isn't the only zombie-esque thriller from South Korea to push the envelope with creative storytelling and cinematography. Totally agree. Directed by Hong-jin Na. She was very believable. The feeling of dread. However, after watching it again, pondering it, and then reading and watching attempts by various people to interpret/explain it, I have come to a different conclusion.
