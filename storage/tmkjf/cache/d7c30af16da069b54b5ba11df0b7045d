The basis for Spencer's appeal to many of his generation was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith at a time when orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science. Some may believe in Spencer's survival of the fittest within the confines of a natural rights philosophy, but others have rejected his ideas of linear progress and replaced them with the paradigm shift ideas of Thomas Kuhn . It can be termed the collective or creative consciousness." The exception to Spencer's growing conservatism was that he remained throughout his life an ardent opponent of imperialism and militarism. He goes on to say that America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. Herbert Spencer. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. [40], In a letter to the Japanese government regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that "if you mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neither—a constitution which will not work properly." He never married, and after 1855 was a perpetual hypochondriac[16] who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose at that time. Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace's nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development' (Lewes' phrase). While investigating facts about Herbert Spencer Theory and Herbert Spencer Sociology, I found out little known, but curios details like:. "Spencer, Herbert (1820–1903)", Hodgson, Geoffrey M. "Social Darwinism in Anglophone Academic Journals: A Contribution to the History of the Term" (2004) 17, Stewart, Iain. Elliott, Paul. He predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state. However, he recognized that our inherited moral constitution does not currently permit us to behave in full compliance with the code of Absolute Ethics, and for this reason we need a code of 'Relative Ethics' which takes into account the distorting factors of our present imperfections. Which phrase best represents the beliefs of Herbert Spencer? [citation needed] In the United States, where pirated editions were still commonplace, his authorised publisher, Appleton, sold 368,755 copies between 1860 and 1903. Militant society, structured around relationships of hierarchy and obedience, was simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, was complex and differentiated. [36] Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s. Concluding Remarks of Herbert Spencer: Herbert Spencer was the chief protagonist of the highly criticized doctrine—the survival of … Other friends were the writer George Henry Lewes, the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, and the philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill. "[49], Spencer's ideas became very influential in China and Japan largely because he appealed to the reformers' desire to establish a strong nation-state with which to compete with the Western powers. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end it took him twice as long and consumed almost all the rest of his long life. In 1851 he published Social Statics, which contained in embryo most of his later views, including his argument in favour of an extreme form of economic and social laissez-faire. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses. Herbert Spencer was a leading philosopher of the mid-nineteenth century and an early sociologist who developed the concept of social Darwinism and coined the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’. Spencer himself introduced the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained his lifelong friend. In The Man Versus the State (1884),[31] he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal Party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called "Construction", an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed). While the overall influence that "The Philosophy of Style" had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer's voice lent authoritative support to formalist views of rhetoric. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a very large extent an extended debate with Spencer, from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.[44]. Spencer’s father, William George Spencer, was a schoolmaster, and his parents’ dissenting religious convictions inspired in him a nonconformity that continued active even after he had abandoned the Christian faith. ... Herbert Spencer, Social Statics (New York: Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, 1970), chapter IV, paragraph 3. Kymlicka, Will (2005). [27] He also argued that the individual had a "right to ignore the state. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.[10]. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified beliefs. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous. The awe inspired by dead {death}, and the fear created by the dead who had passed beyond the control of the living, constitute the two factors which arouse a new sense in man; and as far back as we can go men are seen offering sacrifices to the spirits of their ancestors. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was known as one of the leading Social Darwinists of the 19th century was an English philosopher and prolific writer 4. Nonetheless, unlike Thomas Henry Huxley, whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at 'the unpardonable sin of faith' (in Adrian Desmond's phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned to undermine religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two. He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a 'social organism' evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. He has been claimed as a precursor by right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists. Spencer in his book Principles of Biology (1864), proposed a pangenesis theory that involved "physiological units" assumed to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics to offspring. Charles Darwin once called him “the greatest living philosopher in England.” They would also instinctively respect the rights of others, leading to the universal observance of the principle of justice – each person had the right to a maximum amount of liberty that was compatible with a like liberty in others. Spencer was one of the most-argumentative and most-discussed English thinkers of the Victorian era. He is also remembered for introducing the term survival of the fittest. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was railway engineer turned evolutionary philosopher who proposed his own hypothesis of the evolution and development of religious thought. Given the primacy which Spencer placed on evolution, his sociology might be described as social Darwinism mixed with Lamarckism. His political philosophy could both provide inspiration to those who believed that individuals were masters of their fate, who should brook no interference from a meddling state, and those who believed that social development required a strong central authority. Spencer was born in Derby, England, on 27 April 1820, the son of William George Spencer (generally called George). In his famed work Social Statics (1850), he argued that imperialism had served civilization by clearing the inferior races off the earth: "The forces which are working out the great scheme of perfect happiness, taking no account of incidental suffering, exterminate such sections of mankind as stand in their way. In my last essay I noted the stress that Herbert Spencer placed on sentiments, or moral feelings, and how he regarded sentiments as more fundamental than ideas in achieving a free society. Herbert Spencer was arguably the greatest English philosopher of the 19th century. Because human instincts had a specific location in strands of brain tissue, they were subject to the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance so that gradual modifications could be transmitted to future generations. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Green, G.E. [15] His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to support himself solely on the profit of book sales and on income from his regular contributions to Victorian periodicals which were collected as three volumes of Essays. Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Nevertheless, he devoted much of his efforts in reinforcing his arguments and preventing the misinterpretation of his monumental theory of non-interference. 1853) – See: In 1844, Spencer published three articles on phrenology in, Ronald F. Cooney, "Herbert Spencer: Apostle of Liberty", Chris Matthew Sciabarra, "Libertarianism", in. Speakers have persuasive effect not only by the reasoning of their words, but by their cadence and tone – the musical qualities of their voice serve as "the commentary of the emotions upon the propositions of the intellect," as Spencer put it. A comparison can be made of such state with Thermodynamic equilibrium, a state with no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy. Spencer was born in Derby, England on 27 April 1820, the eldest of nine children, but the only one to survive infancy. Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value – the greatest happiness of the greatest number – and the culmination of the evolutionary process would be the maximization of utility. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) argues that political and economic “dissenters” should have the same right as religious dissenters to have their different beliefs and practices respected by the state:. This permitted the adoption of a developmental perspective not merely in terms of the individual (as in traditional psychology), but also of the species and the race. This Herbert Spencer believed to be the most primitive form of religion. Indeed, he thought that the Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges. In physical evolution, a movement is from indefinite incoherent situation to definite and coherent situation. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). Spencer's attempt to explain the evolution of complexity was radically different from that to be found in Darwin's Origin of Species which was published two years later. Thomas Spencer (14 October 1796 – 26 January. The expression "There is no alternative" (TINA), made famous by prime minister Margaret Thatcher, may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applied in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte's term for the new discipline) and morality. Updated January 13, 2019 Herbert Spencer was a British philosopher and sociologist who was intellectually active during the Victorian period. Please select which sections you would like to print: While every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies. However, it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic and with Auguste Comte's positivism and which set him on the road to his life's work. Between 1854 and 1859 he published a series of essays on education, which were collected in Education: Intellectual, Moral, and Physical (1861). Spencer wrote a number of books. The early 20th century was hostile to Spencer. [39] Focusing on the form as well as the content of Spencer's "Synthetic Philosophy", one writer has identified it as the paradigmatic case of "social Darwinism", understood as a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science. [50] Spencerism was so influential in China that it was synthesized into the Chinese translation of the Origin of Species, in which Darwin’s branching view of evolution was converted into a linear-progressive one. Jack London went so far as to create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. In recent years, much more positive estimates have appeared,[47] as well as a still highly negative estimate. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer,[9] vicar of Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed Spencer's limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough Latin to enable him to translate some easy texts. In 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature, that was assigned to the German Theodor Mommsen. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: "They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. He argued that by making the meaning as readily accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency. Huxley that met every month and included some of the most prominent thinkers of the Victorian age (three of whom would become presidents of the Royal Society). Most of the current supporters or defenders of Herbert Spencer, including classical liberals, anarchists, libertarians, and perhaps some conservatives do so for his political philosophy. His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and into many other languages and he was offered honours and awards all over Europe and North America. He was the product of an undisciplined, largely informal education. Hence anything that interfered with the 'natural' relationship of conduct and consequence was to be resisted and this included the use of the coercive power of the state to relieve poverty, to provide public education, or to require compulsory vaccination. In post-1863-Uprising Poland, many of Spencer's ideas became integral to the dominant fin-de-siècle ideology, "Polish Positivism". In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). He utilized the principles of physical and biological evolution in order to elaborate and explain his theory of Social evolution. “Synthetic Philosophy” 5. In Distributive Justice Debates in Social and Political Thought: Perspectives on Finding A Fair Share. [20] The alleged contradiction between Spencer's theory and the second law of thermodynamics might arise from limiting the definition of homogeneity and heterogeneity to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of matter. On the other hand, the directions of motion of the molecules become more heterogeneous. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views. Over the course of many generations the evolutionary process would ensure that human beings would become less aggressive and increasingly altruistic, leading eventually to a perfect society in which no one would cause another person pain.

The name of Herbert Spencer has been long associated, in the public mind, with the idea of Evolution.… That the system of doctrine put forth by Mr. Spencer would meet with strong opposition was inevitable. This figure did not differ much from his sales in his native Britain, and once editions in the rest of the world are added in the figure of a million copies seems like a conservative estimate. "[28] As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of patriotism. In order to prepare the ground for The Principles of Sociology, Spencer started in 1873 a series of works called Descriptive Sociology, in which information was provided about the social institutions of various societies, both “primitive” and “civilized.” The series was interrupted in 1881 because of a lack of public support. However, for evolution to produce the perfect individual it was necessary for present and future generations to experience the 'natural' consequences of their conduct. [citation needed] As William James remarked, Spencer "enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally. Science and philosophy, he held, gave support to and enhanced individualism and progress. "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know." WORKS BY SPENCER.
