A male California sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. [7] Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. [45] The females in these groups will mount each other as well as the males. Elevated water temperatures reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the California sea lion pup diet during nursery season. Average length at birth is 30 inches (75 cm). California Sea Lions can be found in the North Pacific Ocean along the west coast of North America. https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/california-sea-lion/care-of-young Adult females spend 1.6-1.9 days on land and 1.7-4.7 days at sea. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). Breeding and pupping season falls between early May until late July. [38], Because of their intelligence and trainability, California sea lions have been used by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. [3] The face of adult males may also be light tan in some areas. These include "whinny" sounds, barks, buzzings, and clicks. Pups weigh 13 to 20 pounds at birth; they are usually weaned after 12 months. [22] California sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them. [18], During the breeding season, California sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. Territorial males are the loudest and most continuous callers, and barks are produced constantly during the peak of the breeding season. Females may wean pups at six months of age, but pups may continue to nurse for up to a year or more. Gestation period (days) Reference Min Max Average Alpaca: 345 Baboon: 185 Bear 220 Bear 215 Bear 241 Beaver: 122 American bison: 217 Camel 360 420 390 Cat 58 67 64 Chimpanzee: 230 250 240 Chinchilla: 105 115 110 Chipmunk: 31 Cow: 279 292 286 Deer (white-tailed) 201 Dog 58 65 61 Donkey: 335 426 365 California sea lions have an 11-month gestation period and give birth to a single pup in rookeries (Aurioles-Gamboa and Hernández-Camacho, 2015). These marine mammals can dive to depths of 500 feet or more and stay underwater for 20 minutes. Fur on male’s head may become lighter with age. To protect fish, the US states of Oregon and Washington engage in annual kill quotas of California sea lions. Breed mainly at Channel Islands and islands along northern Pacific coast of Baja California as well as in the Gulf of California. [7] Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. With our unique Seal Lion Encounter, you'll go behind the scenes and enjoy 30 minutes with our seal lions in their Aquarium home. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. Zalophus californianus. [7] California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. [7] When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. This "rhythmic entrainment" was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry. (110 kg). Coat appears darker when wet. Females come into heat about two weeks after giving birth; mating typically occurs about 15-30 days after giving birth. [3] Females and juveniles have a tawny brown pelage,[3] although they may be temporarily light gray or silver after molting. California sea lions are particularly intelligent, can be trained to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. [33] California sea lions can produce vocalizations underwater. Adult eats an estimated 5-8% of its body weight every day. The gestation period of the sea lion is 9 months. [32] Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using California sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are "exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors" and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment. [7] Adult males also have a protruding crest which gives them a "high, domed forehead";[8] it is tufted with white hairs. Male does not eat during breeding season. The mother’s will remain on land or ice with their pups for the first couple of weeks of life. Sheds juvenile fur and grows adult fur at 4-6 months of age. Based on a comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, the California and Galapagos sea lions … They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. [3] The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon. Males may bark when threatening other males or during courtship. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The pups are weaned when they are between six and 12 months old, and they reach reproductive maturity when they are four or five years old. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. Marine Mammals of Eastern North Pacific and Artic Waters. Occurs in the Eastern Pacific from Prince William Sound, Alaska to the southern tip of Mexico. Help to feel the shape and size of objects and detect vibrations and sounds. In the Persian Gulf, the animals can swim behind divers approaching a US naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. [14] California sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. Mothers stay in the area until August to raise their pup and breed again. This is likely an adaptation for living in marine coastal habitats. [6] The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. Average dive depth of 66-164 feet (20-50 m); maximum dive depth of about 900 feet (274 m). The California sea lion was described by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. California Sea Lions are mostly seen in the southern half of Vancouver Island though will go as far as southern Alaska. Males are dark brown, while females and young are a uniform tan colour. Average weight at birth is 13-20 lbs. [3], California sea lions communicate with a range of vocalizations. Males form groups of females called rookeries on beaches and compete with other males through physical display, vocalizations and combat to protect their territories. They are also threatened by pollutants like DDT and PCB which accumulate in the marine food chain. California Sea Lion. [19] In 2004, a healthy California sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half a mile from the San Joaquin River.[20]. Maximum weight for female is more than 240 lbs. While feeding, individuals dive for short periods of about 2 minutes to the relatively shallow depths of 26-74m. Both sexes reach sexual maturity by 4-5 years of age. Rotates all four flippers underneath body to walk on land. California sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Odell, D. 1981. RANGE AND HABITAT The California sea lion resides along the Pacific Coast mainly in the waters of central Mexico and California where they breed, but in non-breeding season can be found as far north as Vancouver Island, Canada. California sea lions bark especially rapidly when excited. Diet primarily consists of squid, anchovy, rockfish, whiting and mackerel, though this may vary among populations and throughout range. The gestation period is normally about 9 months, at which point one pup is born to each female although twins do rarely occur. Gender Names – Male – bull; Female – cow; Baby – pup. Males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories,[3] particularly in water. [36] In 2011, a California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing her head in synchronization to musical rhythms. California sea lions live on the western coast of North America from the Baja California peninsula in Mexico to British Columbia. Median lifespan for California sea lion in human care is 23.5 years. Their color ranges from chocolate brown in males to a lighter, golden brown in females. Beginner Environmental Leadership Program, Alliance of Marine Mammals Parks & Aquariums (AMMPA), International Marine Animal Trainer's Association (IMATA). Bring the memories home with you! California sea lions typically breed in early July, and females give birth to one pup after a gestation period of about 11 months. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. [30], Marine biologist Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied the California sea lions' cognitive ability. Maximum weight for male is more than 850 lbs.

[6] Off the Pacific coast of the United States, California sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity, while the Gulf of California population declined by 20% by 2008. [47][48], In January and February 2015, 1450 malnourished or sick California sea lion pups were found along stretches of the California coast, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. California sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. The only other vocalization made by territorial males is a "prolonged hoarse grunt sound" made when an individual is startled by a human. Well-developed sense of smell on land, but cannot smell underwater. [27], California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. After an 11-month gestation period, the female gives birth to a single pup. Normal prey for California sea lions includes anchovies, sardine, whiting, mackerel, rockfish and market squid. Pp. [13], California sea lions have color vision, though it is limited to the blue-green area of the color spectrum. Navy officials say the California sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. When submerged for long periods (5-10 minutes), a sea lion will decrease its heart beat to reduce the amount of oxygen needed. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. Pup is dark brown in color at birth. These sea lions are an intelligent and social species. Other aggressive vocalizations given by females include the "squeal", the "belch", and the "growl". The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed to unprecedentedly warm Pacific coastal waters, related to Pacific decadal oscillation and El Niño, as the likely cause. [9] The flexibility of its spine allows the California sea lion to bend its neck backwards far enough to reach its hindflippers. They travel at an estimated speed of 10.8 km/h, and young sea lions have an initial defecation time averaging 4.2 hours. [41] However, the Navy insists that the California sea lions are removed once their mission is complete. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Found in near-shore waters, on the shores of islands and along the mainland on a variety of substrates including beaches, rocky platforms and outcroppings and man-made structures. Sharks attack California sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface.

Sea lions reach sexual maturity at Gestation period lasts about 11 months, however California sea lion exhibits delayed implantation, meaning that, although the egg is fertilized at the time of mating, it does not implant and begin to develop until sometime in October. [42], The IUCN lists the California sea lion as Least Concern due to "its large and increasing population size. These semi-aquatic mammals feed on fish, squid, and shellfish. Collective Noun – Colony or pod. Diet California Sea Lions mainly feed on fish, such as herring, and squid. They breed on coasts, where a single baby, or pup, is born after 11 months of gestation. Sea lion has 6 species. California sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern. Vocalize through barks, growls, honks and clicks. Large eyes with excellent vision both in and out of water and in low-light conditions. Males are territorial and maintain a harem of around 15 females. [3] Adult females feed between 10–100 km (6.2–62.1 mi) from shore. Females only a third the size of males: The California Sea Lion (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal sea lion of the northern Pacific Ocean. Seattle, Washington: Pacific Search Press. [39], The California sea lion is used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. Young sea lion pups aged 6-12 months can be rescued and brought to MMCC LA if they separate early from their mothers and become dehydrated and malnourished. 67-97 in S Ridgway, R Harrison, eds. Three to … [12] Males may forage as far as 450 km (280 mi) from shore when water temperatures rise. [10] When moving on land, the California sea lion is able to turn its hindflippers forward and walk on all fours. "[2] This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus. [29] They avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic. [17] Although several otariinae have been recorded around the Japanese archipelago in recent years, their exact origins are unclear. As can be seen in the chart, apes (including humans), monkeys, big cats, and rodents can be clearly grouped according to their gestation period. Flippers are supported by a skeletal structure similar to the bones in a human hand. (6-9 kg). California sea lions are highly social and breed around May to June. Males are typically around 2.7 m (8.9 ft) long and weigh up to 350 kg (770 lb), while females are typically around 2.1 m (6.9 ft) and weigh up to 100 kg (220 lb). Stop by our gift shop for all your sea lion gifts or shop online here. Two long, powerful, wing-like front flippers with short claws and two smaller rear flippers. [37] [46], These animals exploit more man-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. From May to August, males establish territories and try to attract females with which to mate. California sea lions have also been observed feeding on chicks of the common murre. Some territories are underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. Males can grow to weigh over 800 pounds (390 kg).

Male has a larger, thicker body shape than female. California Sea Lion(Zalophus californianus) is a large and intelligent mammal species, mostly found Western America. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles (240 km) up the Columbia River. [7] The pelage of adult males can be anywhere from light brown to black, but is typically dark brown. Critics have objected to the killing of the California sea lions, pointing out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. On average, California sea lions are 5-7 feet long. California sea lions of the Gulf of California do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf year-round. Sea lions produce fat rich milk for their pups, which is made up of 35% fat, while cow's milk and human milk contains only 2-4% fat. Sea lions are different than seals due to having small external ear flaps and their ability to bend their rear flippers forward under their bodies to move on land. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. [6], Being sexually dimorphic, California sea lions differ in size, shape, and coloration between the sexes. [30] Females remain with their pups onshore for 10 days and nurse them. California sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Their barks, high-pitched and shorter than those made by males, are used in aggressive situations. California sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by killer whales and great white sharks. Males are highly territorial and polygynous. Males strictly defend their territories, often even fasting (abstaining from food) to maintain their positions within their respective rookeries. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. [3] California sea lions can stay at sea for as long as two weeks at a time. Oldest sea lion recorded in a natural habitat was 17 years old. [43] Applications have been granted for removal of several individual California sea lions at Ballard Locks[44] and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 California sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period. [7], As an otariid, the California sea lion relies on its foreflippers to propel itself when swimming. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. The Natural History and Behavior of the California Sea Lion. They are generally found in open water, where they prefer to fish, but are sometimes found in rivers near the coast as well. The sound a female sea lion gives when calling her pups is called a "pup-attraction call", described as "loud" and "brawling". Handbook of Marine Mammals: vol.
