I also changed the code a little to take 3 types of image each about once per minute: small images for one radio channel, medium for the other radio channel, and large just for storage on the SD card. We tried a few highish points where I got the Yagi aerial out (much more likely to pick up a weak signal) but still got absolutely nothing. The images that i have shown you was taken with a proper point and shoot camera under programmable, Manual and Auto mode.

That was the flight with Eben and Liz from the Raspberry Pi foundation, so rather than lose a precious slot in their over-full diaries I decided to launch a “floater” which was eventually lost over Switzerland and is probably still in hiding somewhere in France.

Hi Dave ,. Dave Akerman put together a high altitude camera set up using a hot air balloon and custom RPi camera enclosure: “Back in March I built a lightweight Raspberry Pi tracker comprising a model A Pi and a pre-production Pi camera built into a foam replica of the Raspberry Pi logo.  The expected flight path showed a landing about 1 hour away by car: And with an expected flight time of over 3 hours that gave us plenty of time to return to my house and watch the images come in. Forgetting this, I asked Julie to drove close to the original landing spot. Whether your interest is in photography of our planet, scientific examination of the environment at high altitudes, the thrill of having your own “near space” program, or getting your commercial logo or object into near space, then high altitude ballooning has something for you. We picked up the signal again when within a mile of his house, and were decoding when about half a mile away.
