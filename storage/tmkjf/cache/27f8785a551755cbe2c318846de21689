The public program for David Claerbout’s exhibition Unseen Sound at Garage features a screening of a film, chosen by the artist, which influenced his understanding of film language and structure. Mr. Lazarescu is a retired Romanian engineer, spending his time in the company of his cats and booze. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu Synopsis: Mr. Lazarescu, a 63 year old lonely man feels sick and calls the ambulance. This is pretty much the set-up to Cristi Puiu's "The Death of Mr. Lazarescu". After suffering head and stomach pains all day, he finally calls for help. "It's a problem of mortality" Because he has been throwing up blood all day, 62-year-old Mr. Lazarescu (Fiscuteanu) calls for an ambulance from his small, decrepit apartment. Puiu's film can be read as an indictment of the inefficiencies of socialized medicine, or, given the fact that the title character's name is a play on "Lazarus," as a spiritual allegory. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu ★★ Moartea Domnului La-zarescu 2005 (R)The title character (Fiscute-nau) is a grubby 62-year-old widower living in a shabby apartment with a lot of cats. The Death of Lazarescu might seem like it may be treading to an inevitable consequence but Cristi Puiu takes us through the process so marvellously that at a point it feels the outcome hardly matters. I suspect medical professionals would see much they recognize in this movie. And the title gives away the ending, so, we are only left with the middle. When he starts feeling unusually ill, he first seeks painkillers from his neighbors. The credits include a long list of technical advisers, but it doesn't take an adviser to convince you the movie is authentic. Mr. Lazarescu could be one of us,or it is but Puiu is more inclined in uncompromisingly portraying the genuine nature of the beings around him. "The Death of Mr. Lazarescu" is only the second film by Mr. Puiu, who wrote the screenplay with Razvan Radulescu. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/14/worldcinema.comedy "The Death of Mr. Lazarescu" is one of the first, if not the first Romanian film to receive huge international fame and actually be released in America in recent times. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu 2005 | R | 2h 34m | Dramas Amid a pandemic, an ailing man waits for his illness to overtake him while being shuttled between hospitals as doctors try to pinpoint a diagnosis.
