The brown velvets are available as homozygous or as heterozygous. Finally, ensure you have a place where you can release your bunnies from their cages to go and play there. The underside of the tail is white while the topside is mostly black with a few white hairs. The ‘almost’ comes into play with the eye color. Rabbits are lagomorphs. The rest of the fur is pure white. The Full Color Gene — The full color gene is expressed anytime it is present. Eye colors can be brown, blue-grey or marbled, however dark brown is preferred. The tips are grey with an uneven black ticking over it. When the chinchilla gene is expressed in rabbits, you generally find white or pearl fur where the full color rabbit has more yellow in the fur. ch = pointed white (or himi, in some breeds) The American Chinchilla rabbits are large-sized bunnies weighing 9-12 lb, with a lifespan of 7-9 years and a commercial body type. This allele is most known for forming shaded colors such as the sable, Siamese Sable, and the Smoke Pearl. Other rabbits such as ermine, squirrel, chocolate chinchilla and lilac ermine also have the cchd gene as the dominant color gene. Donnelly, T. Chinchillas. The rabbit was initially referred to as the Heavyweight Chinchilla when it was accepted to the ARBA in 1924, but the name was later changed to American Chinchilla. But they are more suited to just being a hardy, sturdy and gentle pet. In chinchilla rabbits, However, the bunny remains the rarest in America. Although there are five main color genes than determine the color of a rabbit’s fur, the c-series of genes is called the “color gene.”  The color gene, which controls where  and how much color will be expressed rather than which color will be expressed, is definitely one of the most difficult to understand. Two true-breeding chinchilla rabbits (“c chd-c chd “) will produce chinchilla color family offspring. Junior Bucks and does are usually below six months of age and 9 lbs in weight, Intermediates are aged 6-8 months. Judith Graf, 1991, Color Basics (self-published booklet) Glenna M.Huffmon, 1995, Rabbit Coat Color Genetics (I have the 1995 third edition) Bobby Schott, 1989, Color Genetics of the Netherland Dwarf Rabbit, Xavier Reference Publications, Douglasville Georgia In the rabbit shows, the American Chinchilla attracts a lot of interest because of its great fur. Coat. Chinchilla Rabbit Care, Colors and for Sale, Giant Chinchilla Rabbit Lifespan, Care and for Sale, Can Rabbits Eat Roses – Rose Bushes and Petals. Urine may also be cloudy. Outdoor cages must be secure and weatherproof. When breeding to animals with the chinchilla gene, you may get "self chins" which will look like a self, but the eye-color may be incorrect. The dominant color gene is the “Full Color” gene represented by the capital “C.”  Some full color rabbits are black, orange, chestnut, black tortoiseshell, lilac, and blue. I live in Louisiana I am looking for a rabbit to breed with the wild rabbits to pick up the population. Can Rabbits Eat Nuts Including Monkey Nuts? That is, two true-breeding full color (“C-C”) rabbits will produce all “C-C” offspring. However, it is a good breeder with its litter of kits averaging between 6-9 kits and an excellent hardy pet for those who want to keep it including for heritage. Some rabbit colors are rarer than others, such as the silver and lilac colors, while others are often seen in pet stores. There are five combinations of genes that will cause a rabbit to be “full color.”  A full color rabbit may be “C-C,” “C-cchd,” “C-cchl,” “C-ch,” or “C-c.”  In full color rabbits, the color is not restricted to a certain part of the rabbit, but it spread over the entire rabbit. It's actually not uncommon for breeders to mistake a Fawn for a Lynx. The sable gene tends to muddy the color, due to its incomplete dominance/recessive nature (more below on that). In the rabbit shows, the American Chinchilla attracts a lot of interest because of its great fur. This is called the chinchilla light allele. Rabbits which are shaded carriers (Cchl) often have a ruby cast to their eyes. They have a docile temperament making them easy to handle and pet. Despite their name, they are not related to and cannot interbreed with chinchillas, which are a species of rodent.

The  cchd gene causes the yellow pigment to be reduced. Secondly, groom them regularly by brushing their fur to avoid matting and remove any debris with a slicker brush, once in a week or as you may deem necessary. However, the color can vary from yellow to orange or even red/brown. Your email address will not be published. The color is agouti in nature, i.e., shows different colors for different fur lengths.

Their ears are not too long and stand erect from their heads, with a plain dark grey/blue on the outside lined by the chinchilla markings along the edges and white to pink inside. Note that the spots obtained from Chinchilla have been used to develop several other breeds including the American Sables, Silver Martens (both in the US) and the Sallander and Siamese Sable in other countries. The classic wild rabbit color, chestnuts are the most common of all the agouti colors. Once the yellow pigment is eliminated from the orange, only the pearl remains. Most are lively, sociable and gentle.”. The first complication is that there are more variations of this gene than of most color genes.  Black ticking are unevenly distributed over most of the body. Chinchilla rabbits can be either “cchd-cchd,” “cchd-cchl,” “cchd-ch,” or “cchd-c.”  When the chinchilla gene is expressed in rabbits, you generally find white or pearl fur where the full color rabbit has more yellow in the fur. ...

This creates an interesting effect when the hair passes over bulges, such as at the shoulders of the rabbit, making the bunny look textured. Pets4Homes states that their “under color, which is nearest the skin, is a deep slate blue, the middle color is a pearl white, and the tips are grey” in addition to the liberally scattered black guard hairs. The c chd gene causes the yellow pigment to be reduced. It lacks ring color and a clean fawn will lack blue or dove gray in the surface color. International Journal of the Bioflux Society. Included in this rabbit color chart is orange, cream, frosty, chinchilla, chestnut, opal, sable point, black tort, blue tort, chocolate tort, lilac, black, blue, chocolate, blue eyed white (BEW), ruby eyed white (REW), magpie, tri-color, harlequin, black and blue otter, vienna mark, and more bunny color examples! Chd is not completely dominant over chl. Any overweight bunny will be shown in a level higher than they belong. Coat . Chinchilla is caused by the "c(chd)" Genes.

Just like with other genes, if you breed two true-breeding color gene domestic rabbits together, you will have offspring of the same. The Sable Gene — With the sable gene (cchl), we find a slightly different situation than with other genes:  incomplete dominance. Sapphire Chinchillas are very similar to Violet Chinchillas in that they don’t have a black tip … It is worthwhile to note that the best chinchilla colors are produced with either a double cchd, a REW or Himalayan gene under the chinchilla gene rather than a sable gene. Shaded (c chl) is recessive to normal and chinchilla genes, but incompletely dominant to the other C-series genes. Himalayans come in just two geneotypes:  “ch-ch” and “ch-c.”. Fawn is not recognized and therefore, not showable. Chinchilla rabbits carrying the shaded allele (A-chdchl) MAY look like normal chins or they may … When it first … Colors. Copyright © 2021.

Chinchilla rabbits can be either “c chd -c chd ,” “c chd -c chl ,” “c chd -c h ,” or “c chd -c.”. The REW gene is the most recessive on the c-locus. An average chinchilla rabbit has a medium built and compact body. A self-chinchilla ( if the eyes are brown) can be registered as a black, again because ARBA varieties are based on appearance. The sable gene removes yellow from hair shafts and removes some of the darker pigments, giving a Holland Lop a shaded look (again, this shaded look is different from the shaded look caused by ee genes).

The next gene is the sable gene represented by cchl, which stands for “chinchilla-light.”  Smoke pearl and sable point are examples of rabbits with the chl as the dominant color gene. The standard grey is the natural color of the grey chinchilla. Beginning with the most dominant and ending with the least, the color genes are “C,” which is the full color gene, “cchd,” which is the chinchilla gene, “cchl,” which is the sable gene, “ch,” which is the Himalayan gene, and “c,” which is the REW or albino gene.
