Genetic impossibility negatively affects an otherwise good story. The hamlet of CloichÃ­n is said to be a veritable Eden, with its prosperous farms and close-knit, friendly community. Saving the man's life, Fidelma is determined that the villagers must give the newcomer a fair trial. When they arrive in the village they interrupt a hanging and meet some pretty odious people who appear to be led by a fantastical Catholic priest. I really love these books. His character development and his plotting are wonderful in each one. After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in. A drowned woman...a village scandal...can Ela find the killer? It is Fidelma at her best with Eadulf at her side. Sometimes his books get a bit pedantic and long-winded, but they are never boring because his Sister Fidelma books are impeccably written. But after a local farmer, his wife and two sons are murdered, a fanatical new priest orders the villagers to lynch the man accused of the crime. Tremayne is at top of his writing still. She can untwist this overly complex mystery but who cares? Oona never expected to be dragged into a magical murder investigation. Closer to a 4.5. I enjoy the Sister Fidelma mysteries because they are good stories and I also get to learn a lot about Ancient Ireland's customs and laws. He didn't resolve all of the issues but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This story begins with Eadulf and Fidelma returning home from a trip away from Cashel in the month of February 671 AD, when they realize that the inn where they planned to stay has burned to the ground.
