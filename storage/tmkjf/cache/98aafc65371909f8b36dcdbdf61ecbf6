In general, the characters are not as interesting as the characters of SIII, which had the best characterization and design. The same reviewer gave Suikoden III a 9.4, after all. TESTS . 7.9. Review. Five or 10 seconds ago? Februar 2015: Offizielle Seiten. 			                                What's this? It's that the ending feels contrived and artificial, and leaves the players wanting so much more that even a second play through can't remedy the feeling of crushing disappointment that "that's all there is.". It has been some time since I played Suikoden IV last, so it took me a little time to remember the controls.
