Traditionally, cutting very low to the ground (say 3 cm / 1.2 in) is said to improve yield by encouraging new shoots to form their own root systems. This silvicultural system  is normally implemented in forests that are considered mature, often after several  thinnings. It involves cutting trees in a series of cuttings, allowing new seedlings to grow from the seeds of older trees. 0000008722 00000 n There are two objectives of a shelterwood cut - making ground space available by cutting trees of lowering value and using trees increasing in value as a seed source and for seedling protection as these trees continue to financially mature. Shelterwood cutting also removes all the trees in an area, but does it in stages over several years.
