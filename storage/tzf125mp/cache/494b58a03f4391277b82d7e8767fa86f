What problems did they face? Whether this is a description of his race is unclear. The equivalent of Emperor Palpatine from the Star Wars Universe, he's as treacherous as villains get, which is why fans were excited to see Netflix's Voltron: Legendary Defender make him the main tyrant for most of the series.. Captain Nerok: “I’m afraid I bring you very bad news from Planet Doom.”, Keezor: “Bah! New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast, Press J to jump to the feed. I recall three instances in DoTU where a character tells Lotor that he’s just like his father. Originally, the Black Paladin of Voltron named Zarkon hungered for power and began to expand his rule. Lotor wondered why he didn't figure it out sooner. Montgomery adds that killing Zarkon was a surefire way for Lotor, Team Voltron’s former enemy turned “ally,” to earn the heroes’ trust. The power will only be down for 20 minutes. The music used in the unaired pilot episode of Lion Voltron was not used in the series itself. It gets to the point that he can’t talk to or about Lotor without injecting some comment about how his son is an idiot, a failure, and worthless. Personally, I believe Zarkon behaves this way, at least partly, because he doesn’t see Lotor as a full person. (Maybe.). These episodes and the Fleet of Doom movie are not canon to GoLion or Dairuggar AT ALL. The creature gazed back in Lotor’s eyes, the boy seeming to swear it was pleading with him, asking him why it was made to suffer. There they encounter Space Goddess herself, who offers them entry into paradise. The first time I remember another character telling Lotor he’s like his father is in the episode “Zarkon Is Dying”. Episode to shine: Plays a major role in many episodes, but if I had to pick one I’d go with “It’s Anybody’s World.”, Did Allura get married to Keith in the 80s original Voltron. Zarkon didn’t understand why Lotor had refused to send her away, but he intended to get an answer for that action. Because as it stands the confrontation looks like Lotor confessing to [A]; Allura accusing him of [X^X]. He absolutely hates Hazar for his attempts at peacemaking and, it’s implied, is jealous of Hazar’s power. Despite in theory answering the Empire’s ruler Emperor Zeppo and his Supreme Council, Zarkon is something of an outlaw within the empire. Lotor could easily have been lying. However, the cracks in their relationship show almost immediately afterwards. It should be noted that while Honerva was Sincline’s grandmother in GoLion, Haggar and Lotor are not related in Voltron. Prince Lotor: [the screen showing him and Haggar shuts off] Not to *you*, maybe, old man. Episode to shine: Zeppo’s role isn’t nearly as large as you’d think. Because he was too clever for his own good? The script for “Yurak Gets His Pink Slip” refers to Lotor as an Orkan. About a decade or so prior to the series he invaded planet Arus, devastating the planet and taking most of the world’s population as his slaves. However, after Zarkon is defeated by Voltron, he changes his mind about Lotor and it’s by his command Lotor is freed. 3)WEP didn’t have access to translations of the original scripts, meaning they had to watch the episodes and the write their scripts from the ground up based on what they saw. Lotor hates and resents his father, and sees him as an obstacle getting between him and what he wants. He doesn’t get much screen time until late in the series. These edits changed or erased entire plot lines, like Shiro/Sven’s death, the fate of Raible/Coran’s wife and son, Earth being destroyed by World War III, and Sincline/Lotor being part Altean. Just before Zarkon can disown him in the most permanent way possible, Haggar dashes into the arena to reason with Zarkon. Hopefully I can answer those questions for you in today’s post. There are A LOT of them, so I’ve narrowed it down to the ones who either played a major role in the series or who I personally found memorable. While Daibazaal is away on Altea (Arus), Sincline’s followers free him. Lotor has failed time after time to capture minor planets and bring them into the Drule Empire. Keep in mind this is not a complete list of all the Drule characters. (Probably. It's interesting to note that Lotor doesn't engage her at all after he says "destroy the lions" (not "kill the paladins"), he just draws her away. When Zarkon returns to Doom, Lotor has him arrested and orders Haggar to craft a robeast fit for an ex-king. Because I’ve seen discussion about this pop up recently…. However, as with many of aspects of DoTU, the original version of the Galra/Drules are very different from what current Voltron fans are familiar with. A fuck up that lead to a civil war, the end of the alliance, the murder of the blades and the Earth being drawn into a massive conflict they couldn't hope to win. Maybe they ment emotionally, he's about 16. The first episode in Netflix is triple-length, creating a cumulative runtime for the season equal to the industry standard of 13 episodes, while other streaming services such as iTunes and Amazon have three separated episodes with the normal length of 23 minutes. What does he hope to accomplish there all by himself? Zarkon sees Lotor as a tool whose purpose is to bring his greater power and glory. He pretty much does whatever he wants and pursues his own goals, even when they run counter to his “master’s” interests. or. About: Throk is one of the most power hungry, prideful, and outspoken members of the Supreme Council. Because team Voltron is wrong about Lotor, and so are you. Smash it into spacedust!”Imaginary!Zarkon: “Are you having trouble, my bumbling son? Dairugger Name: Supreme Commander Al Caponero. Lotor eagerly showers his father with ships full of treasure and slaves plundered from conquered worlds. Zarkon strikes me as a man driven to be strong enough to protect his family; everything he did was motivated by that pre rift poisoning--maybe even a little after, but over time he loses his memory of why he needs to be strong and it just becomes an end unto itself and he turns into a cruel shell of himself. Zarkon has personally taken it upon himself to also train Lotor like Keith. However, one major twist came with the revelation Zarkon was actually the Paladin for the … Over 10,000 years ago, Zarkon was an ally of King Alfor of Altea and worked with him to create Voltron from a comet that fell from the sky before assuming the role of Black Paladin and Alfor assuming the role of Red Paladin to face of to an unknown life form escape from the rift. The may be because localizing GoLion was, really, something of an afterthought while Dairugger was what originally caught WEP’s eye. What were the politics of the empire like? This undoubtedly led to changes in characterizations and stroylines. And it may be for the best. But the differences run deeper than that. 5. Ouch! As for the hundreds of years part, well, thinking back on it, there was a conquered planet his father had in his grasp which produced flowers with strong curative powers--which they harvested and used, and this would make sense as to why Zarkon, and Lotor, are described as being so long lived. Speak, Haggar! I think zarkok was so corrupted-at that point he couldn’t feel any affection. !”, Nerok: “Zarkon has lost.”Keezor: “I feared as much. At the end of Vehicle Voltron he and a few other members of the council flee planet Drule and presumably joins Emperor Zeppo on planet Dema. I also think that's why you don't see much expressed sadness from Lotor after he kills his father too. Therefore any characters or plot elements from VV that are mentioned or seen in LV do not exist in GoLion. Zarkon is deathly ill and the only cure is a berry unique to Arus/Altea. This scene was too familiar. It was never clear that was up. Plus, Lotor was always trying to be better than his father Emperor Zarkon. Yesterday, she didn't even say anything to him as he carried her through the forest. These events take place in the episode “Zarkon Becomes a Robeast.” The episode begins with Zarkon ordering Lotor’s imprisonment, stating that their laws demand all those who lose in battle be punished. Together they formed Voltron wit… Zarkon: “My son has gone to Planet Arus alone. 4. The fact he is suggests Zarkon never really believed in Lotor’s, expected Lotor to fail at some point, and any of sort of pride he had in son’s accomplishments was fragile and fleeting at best. Most character deaths, scenes of characters literally being sliced in half,  sexual assault, and all references to Sincline/Lotor’s mother were edited out. In Vehicle Voltron they make the occasional reference to places and characters from the Lion Voltron series, but that’s the extent of it. The following is a list of episodes from the series Voltron: Legendary Defender.The first season was released on June 10, 2016. The Supreme Council is shocked by the news of Lotor’s imprisonment and, at first, many members wonder if it’s true. Lotor, over time, comes to despise his father, increasingly desperate to get out from under daddy’s boot heel and take the throne for himself. He manages to avoid capture by promising Hazar he’ll give up his war making ways if the rebels let him go. But she was trying to kill him and would have since her shots were accurate but her tracking was off because his fighter was faster than what she was used to. Crush Voltron! Nerok, when have we ever had good news from that planet? Zarkon and Haggar’s attitudes towards one another during the events that led up to Blackout. Mwahahaha!”, Lotor: “I’ll show you, father! The King wasn’t the only one upset about Allura’s continued presence in Lotor’s life, Princess Corral and her father had gotten in contact with Zarkon. Zarkon is referred to as Malvor in some of the pages of “The Princess Joins Up” script, suggesting this may have possibly been the originally intended name for him. Keezor: “Yes it’s true that King Zarkon has removed Prince Lotor from command of his forces and placed him prison. Unlike VLD Lotor, however, DoTU Lotor’s reactions to this comparison changes each time, perhaps a reflection of his deteriorating relationship with his father throughout the series. Zarkon’s relationship with the core of the empire is, as you can imagine, very strained. You’re an instrument of evil as I’ve raised you to be!”. GoLion and Voltron: Defender of the Universe are not the same show. Now free, the Voltron Force flies off to Arus while pondering the mysteries of the universe and determined to make the most of their lives. The reason for Lotor's exile is because he befriended and worked alongside a civilization he was ordered to govern, instead of subjugating them and mining Quintessence to the detriment of their planet. I wanted to go into a bit more detail about this because it illustrates how much more how influential the footage taken from Dairugger was on the Lion Voltron series than the other way around. Lotor, unwilling to marry anyone but Allura, protests his father’s actions. Zarkon’s voice sounds more like a child telling his mother that he knows what he’s doing and to but out. He tells me of the many planets he’s conquered throughout the galaxy. Robot: “His majesty, King Zarkon, is on the space scope.”, Lotor: “I don’t need HIM telling me what to do!”. The Drules are Voltron: Defender of the Universe’s equivalent of VLD’s Galra. So it seems Keezor isn’t exactly a fan of either Zarkon or Lotor. I don’t think there was ever any real love or fondness between these two, and the events of the series show it. The identity of Zarkon’s former wife and Lotor’s mother is never explored in the show. [Name] used her knife to flick Lotor's sword out of his hand and across the room, she pushed him down on the floor and placed a foot on his chest. Emperor Zarkon was the former ruler of Planet Daibazaal and the original Black Paladin who ruled the Galra Empire that had conquered almost all of the known universe over the past ten thousand years. "Emperor Zarkon: Bring me Lotor and the prisoner is yours. There are a few major reasons why GoLion and DoTU are so different from each other: 1) DoTU was created by combining footage and plot elements from two previously unrelated animes: GoLion and Dairugger XV, which were used to create the Lion Voltron and Vehicle Voltron  portions of DoTU, respectively. Zarkon kicked Lotor in the stomach and something cracked, instead of saying anything Lotor winced. Lotor’s blood. However, due to Lotor's stubborn ways, he only trains him in sword fighting and Dagger wielding. Interesting how the scar on his left eye looks like tears falling. Lotor hates and resents his father, and sees him as an obstacle getting between him and what he wants. But was their relationship always like that? Lance McClain a used to be loner and freak at Garrison high school. ), B. Now Zarkon is taking over and if he can do no better, it may be time to dispose of him as well.”. Their relationship, fractured from the start with the death of his mother, is a horrid, hateful thing, a bloodline shrouded in disdain and disgust and deceit. King Kova, Romelle and Bandor’s father, was originally named Dane. Let us look at these instances in more detail. Lotor was the son of Galra Emperor Zarkon and Altean Alchemist Empress (I don't know. King Alfor of Altea hid I’ve discussed the Drules as a people  on this blog before but haven’t talk about the individual characters very much besides Hazar and Dorma. Well, we’ll correct that. However, Haggar disguised herself as the Space Goddess to lure Voltron in close enough to hit him with a massive magical blast. Already we see hints Lotor resents his father’s authority over him. Therefore I’ve written some brief biographies about some of the Drules in the Vehicle Voltron season of Voltron: Defender of the Universe. This isn’t going anywhere good, folks. GoLion contains a lot of scenes considered inappropriate for American children. But, like his father and as a result of his military training and upbringing, he has a need to take control or appear to be in control at all times. "Why do you hate me?" No. I’ve mentioned the Space Goddess  in previous posts but since I’ve seen some speculation about her, I’m going ahead and writing a post about her role in Voltron: Defender of the Universe. Has he just forgotten his most important supporter is an Altean? Since Lotor mentions having nephews, it’s possible Zarkon has at least two grandchildren somewhere. She can allow them to go back and save it but by doing so they forfeit their chance to pass into the realm of eternal happiness. At this point Zarkon has no legitimate reason to doubt Lotor’s competence like this. I’m just as much a conqueror as you ever were!”. At some point in the distant past he met and seduced a young Haggar for her beauty and magical abilities. ), D. Zarkon hated the idea of having an heir because it suggested he himself was mortal? And, no, Lotor wasn’t lying about his conquests. Corruption from massive amounts of Quintessence and the darkness of an Alternate Reality led Zarkon to violently turn against King Alfor and attempt to claim Voltron for himself. King Zarkon: Lotor, you're not thinking of saving the Princess, are you? The episode ends with Lotor tossing Romelle into the Pit of Skulls. In a much later episode, “Zarkon Becomes a Robeast” Haggar confirms Lotor conquered numerous worlds, which all have sworn allegiance to him. When we were first introduced to Lotor, as a captive, not as an antagonist, I think it would pretty safe to assume that many people, myself included, knew that he was going to return back to being a villian. https://voltron.fandom.com/wiki/Zarkon_(Legendary_Defender) It’s emotional manipulation at it’s cruelest, and this is only the first of the one-two punch that’s due to land it’s second hit next season. One day he challenges the goddess, who splits him into five pieces as punishment for his arrogance. Prince Avok, Romelle and Bandor’s older brother, was originally named Gil. And he tried to blame his son, Prince Lotor, on all their miserable failures.”, Keezor: “Well, Zarkon has had his chance and I now believe it’s because of him Lotor didn’t do better. Lotor doesn’t really agree with his father’s methods so he does his own thing. Because the story is broken. How do the Drules depicted in Lion Voltron compare to those in Vehicle Voltron? Zarkon sees Lotor as a tool whose purpose is to bring his greater power and glory. You have no feelings! 90% of his schemes rely on Haggar. So when Lotor is born both Haggar and Zarkon feels no real connection to him, and as he grows up to resent all that they are. His family consists of his son Prince Lotor and his human-looking nephew Tabor. 23. But it has been on it’s way to being broken for a long, long time. Too familiar. ), C. Lotor's story about saving that planet against Zarkon's wishes? He’s vocally opposed any sort of cooperation with the Galaxy Alliance, seeing them as invaders out to steal planets that rightly belong to the Drule Empire. Holding his stomach as Zarkon started to walk out, the bottoms of his boots getting covered with blood. Lotor invokes Right of Might, which is a duel to the death for the throne, on his father. Lotor’s emotions and agency are, at best, a nuisance and his value to Zarkon hinges solely on how useful he is and how he can be used to Zarkon’s benefit. By failing to defeat Voltron, Lotor is failing at this, and thus becomes a worthless nuisance to him. Anyway, that's just me applying some psychology to their relationship. Lotor questioned, pouting as he dodged another of [Name]'s attacks. While watching watching a battle between a robeast and Voltron, Lotor imagines Zarkon mocking him as events take a turn for the worst. But Zarkon is still his father, and Lotor is still his son. Is my son just an idle braggart?”. In “The Sincerest Form of Flattery” Lotor challenges Zarkon to a duel to the death, only to lose and be saved from execution by Haggar. Is it because you’re not the man you thought you were? She's not worth the risk. Hope that helps anyone interested with their speculations. Over the years he conquered most of the Denubian Galaxy. That could ruin the whole plan. Regardless of their personal motives, Zarkon and Lotor’s relationship is cruel and dysfunctional. Likely anything less was punished or could result in him being killed. The Space Goddess is first mentioned  by Coran while telling Keith and others about how Voltron, which was built as a single robot, was split into five lions. While not weak, she was subservient to him and used him to achieve her own selfish whims when it came to Altean magic.  That king Zarkon: “ my son has gone to planet Arus alone posted! With blood his palace thus becomes a worthless nuisance to him as well. ” you not...: “ yes it ’ s eye notable Drules s older brother, was named! The many planets he ’ s post killed king Alfor in battle you,... Entry into paradise away on Altea ( Arus ), D. Zarkon hated the of. However, upon escape he makes for planet Dema where he ’ s like. Or Throk, etc used in the episode “ the Sleeping Princess Zarkon... ) execution ever were! ”, Nerok: “ stop whining to be his good!
