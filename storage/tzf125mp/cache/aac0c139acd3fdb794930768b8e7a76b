Learned (but not learnt) is also an adjective, pronounced as two syllables (ˈlə:n|əd) rather than the one syllable verb (ləːnt or ləːnd). The perceived informality is likely due to the adjective form of “learned,” which we use to describe someone as informed or expertly in a skill, study, or experience. The terms learned and learnt are alternative forms of the past tense and past participle of the verb learn, which means “to gain or acquire knowledge of or skill in something by study, experience, or being taught.” Both words are generally accepted.
