These classes include neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils. They can damage your bones and crowd out healthy blood cells. However, WBCs must be stained in order to distinguish them from each other. Since, they are part of our immune system, they are also called as immune cells.. A white blood cell, also known as a leukocyte or white corpuscle, is a cellular component of the blood that lacks hemoglobin, has a nucleus, is capable of motility, and defends the body against infection and disease.White blood cells carry out their defense activities by ingesting foreign materials and cellular debris, by destroying infectious agents and cancer cells, or by producing antibodies.

These are the second most common white blood cell (20-50%), and are easy to find in blood smears. White blood cells or leukocytes (leukos = white, cytes = cells) are so-called because they are true cells that do not contain the red protein, hemoglobin.The real value of white blood cells is that most are specifically transported to areas of infection, thereby providing a rapid and potent defense against infectious agents. White blood cells are the cells that help the body fight infection There are a number of different types and sub-types of white blood cells which each have different roles to play.

Before a transfusion, white blood cells are often removed to reduce the risk of infections or immune reactions. The three major types of white blood cells are: Granulocytes Monocytes Lymphocytes Granulocytes There are three different forms of granulocytes: Neutrophils Eosinophils Basophils […] All these are the major type of cells that play a vital role in the body. These cells also secrete IgE antibodies to combat allergens. Basically, white blood cells (WBC) help to improve the function of the immune system and combat infections. Blood is specialized fluid connective tissue.It travels through the circulatory system transporting gases, nutrients, wastes, and other macromolecules throughout the body.
