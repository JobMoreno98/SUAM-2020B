Being home after so long made her feel like a teenager again. Which was why she’d chosen the oblivion of alcohol to get her through the worst of her panic. “Who cuts down living things, Lyse—creatures of the Earth that clean the air and give shade to weary travelers?”.

Dev watched as it grew in size, liquid from the sodden jacket sluicing down like dozens of small tributaries heading toward the ocean, feeding the droplet until it was so heavy that gravity couldn’t hold it anymore, and it plummeted to Earth. Day had long faded into inky twilight, the gloaming having come and gone on tiptoe, so Eleanora only now realized the world was dipped in full-scale night. The story is never repetitive or predictable and the characters feel grounded and real. Southern California was dry—the antithesis of Athens, Georgia, where she lived now, which was humidity city.
