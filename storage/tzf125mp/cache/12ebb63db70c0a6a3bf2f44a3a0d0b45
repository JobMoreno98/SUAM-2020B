[55] It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Between 1803 and 1846, 72 American ships were involved in the otter hunt in California, harvesting an estimated 40,000 skins and tails, compared to only 13 ships of the Russian-American Company, which reported 5,696 otter skins taken between 1806 and 1846. Hatch, David R. (2002) Elakha: Sea Otters, Native People, and European Colonization in the North Pacific. At SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, we extend our commitment to the environment beyond our company by supporting a variety of conservation groups and programs. Animalia: information (1) Animalia: pictures (20673) Animalia: specimens (7109) Animalia: sounds (722) Animalia: maps (42) Eumetazoa metazoans. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an endangered species. Parker, S. Byrum, J. [16][49][55] Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens is a major focus for conservation efforts. [141], Sea otters consume over 100 prey species. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Webber. This resulted in an international ban on hunting them via various programs. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth the cost of Bering's expedition. (1963) "Museum materials on the Aleuts". Generally solitary. Semiaquatic. [84] A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. [137] However, the population increased markedly from 2015 to 2016, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the threshold for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Sea Otter is the heaviest of the otters, reaching a maximum weight of 45 kg. [16] Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices,[149] however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. [148] The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. [94] Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometres long, and remain there year-round. [118] By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Sea otters currently have stable populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, with reports of recolonizations in Mexico and Japan. Jefferson, T.J. Leatherwood, S. and M.A. and S. Stephen. [83] Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths. [142] Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. [101] In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. While holding the rock on its chest, the otter pounds the animal on the rock until it breaks or opens. Sea otters are also bilaterally symmetrical, like all other chordates. [55] The sea otter may also pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. [55] Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male biting the female on the muzzle – which often leaves scars on the nose – and sometimes holding her head under water. Otters. It also included Kamchatka, and as far south as Japan. Phylum: Chordata: Class: Mammalia: Order: Carnivora: Family: Mustelidae: Subfamily: Lutrinae: Genus: Enhydra: Species: E. otter. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. [193] The Seattle Aquarium became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of Tichuk in 1979, followed by three more pups in the early 1980s. They prey on sea urchins, preventing them from overgrazing the forest of kelp, which supports marine diversity. Phylum Chordata. [24] It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. On an adult animal, there are an estimated 650,000 hairs per square inch. [129], Although the southern sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant population of about 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. Ge. In addition, white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni), a species never overlapping with sea otter, had declined in numbers 99% by 1996, and became the first marine invertebrate to be federally listed as endangered. [63] Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups,[63] and swim through female areas when searching for a mate. In 1970 and 1971, a total of 95 sea otters were transplanted from Amchitka Island, Alaska to the Southern Oregon coast. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. Further restrictions were ordered by the company in 1834. [23] Females are smaller, weighing 14 to 33 kg (31 to 73 lb) and measuring 1.0 to 1.4 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 7 in) in length. Find a variety of free classroom activities that will keep your students engaged and excited to learn about animals. [181], The debate is complicated because sea otters have sometimes been held responsible for declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity. Taken with tigers? [29] The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. The otter has a lithe and slender body with short legs, a strong neck, and a long flattened tail that helps propel the animal gracefully through water. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. Al. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the oce… Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also reduce the risk of an oil spill wiping out a population. The family of the Southern Sea Otter is Mustelidae. [33] The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. ", Archeological Research Issues for the Point Reyes National Seashore – Golden Gate National Recreation Area, "Sea Otter Show Striking Variability in Diets And Feeding Strategies", "U.S. Additionally, they may be able to shut the ambulacral grooves which contain the tube-feet, and then spread the spines over them protectively. [56] Juveniles are typically independent at six to eight months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it;[77] at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. [44] Seals and sea otters are the only carnivores with two pairs of lower incisor teeth rather than three;[45] the adult dental formula is 3.1.3.12.1.3.2. [52] Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. [72] Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. New York: Random House, 2002. They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts. [16] However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them. These adorable carnivores can be rather cool to read about, especially when you get into behavior, adaptations, and their ecological role in their environment. [21][22], The sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammal species, but it is the heaviest mustelid. [107] By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. United States, otter origins, however one otter had a haplotype not previously reported, and could represent a remnant of the original native Mexican otter population. Sea otters sleep, rest, and usually swim by paddling with their hind flippers on their backs. M. starts with . They have long whiskers, small ear flaps, and two small black eyes. [139], Historian Adele Ogden described sea otters are particularly abundant in "Lower California", now the Baja California Peninsula, where "seven bays...were main centers". In a kelp forest, sea urchins can graze on the kelp and eat their holdfasts, resulting in deforesting the kelp from an area. [16][98][99][100][101], Adele Ogden wrote in "The California Sea Otter Trade" that sea otter were hunted "from Yezo northeastward past the Kuril Group and Kamchatka to the Aleutian Chain". [63] During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males,[63] although actual fighting is rare. It had stopped in the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a conservation measure imposed by the Russian-American Company. sea otter Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Family Mustelidae Genus Species Enhydra lutris. [115], Sea otters were once numerous in San Francisco Bay. [96] By the early 1900s, Baja's sea otters were extirpated by hunting. [85] Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium died at the age of 28 years. This male is thought to have originated from a colony in Washington, but disappeared after a coastal storm. [55][182] Shellfish declines have also occurred in many parts of the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. At birth, the sea otter is covered with dense brownish fur and long silky yellowish-tipped guard hair; over a period of several weeks, the guard hair grows out, often giving the pup a distinct yellowish appearance. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. Eumetazoa: pictures (20647) Eumetazoa: specimens (7100) Eumetazoa: sounds (722) Eumetazoa: maps (42) Bilateria bilaterally symmetrical animals. The southernmost limit was Punta Morro Hermoso about 21.5 miles (34.6 km) south of Punta Eugenia, in turn a headland at the southwestern end of Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay, on the west coast of the Baja Peninsula. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. [16][146] Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested. In 1973, the population in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. [183] Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. Natural oils in a sea otter's fur repel water and trap tiny air bubbles, providing a layer of warm air between the otter's skin and the harsh elements of its environment. Our overarching zoological mission is to foster conservation awareness and to impart action on our park guests to preserve wild animals and wild places. Hear animal sounds for animals like anteaters, dolphins, frogs and more. California sea otters spend almost all of their time in the water, while Alaska sea otters often sleep, groom, and nurse their young on land. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Because they rely on their dense fur for insulation from the chilly ocean water, sea otters are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of an oil spill. [3] When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. Pisaster ochraceous is a predator and is a prey to … These are the first documented sightings of otters this far south in 30 years. [166] When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly extirpated the sea otter again. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. These sea otter may have dispersed from San Nicolas Island, which is 300 kilometres (190 mi) away, as individuals have been recorded traversing distances of over 800 kilometres (500 mi). [192], Sea otters can do well in captivity, and are featured in over 40 public aquariums and zoos. [30], The sea otter displays numerous adaptations to its marine environment. II. It could have traveled to the state from either California or Washington. Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are marine mammals inhabiting the shores of the Aleutian Islands and along the North American coast up to Mexico. [162], Other nations joined in the hunt in the south. Sea otters have been found to play a pivotal role in the habitat and marine life that inhabit a kelp forest. [71] In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years,[24] with lifespans ranging from 10 to 15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. The sea otter is the only otter that… [171] Describing the public sympathy for sea otters that developed from media coverage of the event, a U.S. Find your favorite Animals! The class is Mammalia because it is a warm blooded animal, which has a vertebrate. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Mustelidae Genus: Enhydra (Fleming, 1828) Species • E. lutris Conservation Status (IUCN 3.1) Endangered: The Sea Otter is an otter than lives in marine waters only. [38] The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals[39] – and the air trapped in its fur. sea otters (Enhydra lutris) sea gulls ; Ecosystem Roles. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.[19]. [125] If populations continued to grow and ESA delisting occurred, southern sea otters would still be fully protected by state regulations and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which set higher thresholds for protection, at approximately 8,400 individuals. [176] The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Sea otters are sleek, furry, streamlined marine mammals that live along rocky Pacific Ocean coasts, bays, and kelp beds. [122] By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas,[123] although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. They are found from the coast of California through Alaska and along the eastern coast of Russia to northern Japan. Scientific Name | Enhydra Lutris Life Span | 10 - 15 years (In Wild, Male) In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. ", "Divergent Skull Morphology Supports Two Trophic Specializations in Otters (Lutrinae)", "Bone Inner Structure Suggests Increasing Aquatic Adaptations in Desmostylia (Mammalia, Afrotheria)", "USFWS Species Profile: Southern sea otter (, "Lesions and Behavior Associated with Forced Copulation of Juvenile Pacific Harbor Seals (, Population dynamics and present status of sea otters (, "Sea Otters – Southwest Alaska Sea Otter Recovery Team (SWAKSORT)", "British Columbia: Sea Otter Research Expedition", "California otters rebound, but remain at risk", "Trends in the Abundance and Distribution of Sea Otters (, "Sea Otter Recovery on Vancouver Island's West Coast", "Sea otter's stay raises scientists' hopes", "Bixby Creek Bridge on Highway One from the Pat Hathaway Photo Collection", "Spring 2007 Mainland California Sea Otter Survey Results", "Are sea otters taking a bite out of California's Dungeness crab season? Many Aleuts were either murdered by the Russians or died from diseases the hunters had introduced. The fur trade that began in the 1740s reduced the sea otter's numbers to an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 members in 13 colonies. [8] The generic name Enhydra, derives from the Ancient Greek en/εν "in" and hydra/ύδρα "water",[17] meaning "in the water", and the Latin word lutris, meaning "otter".[18]. Population. [187], Among the Ainu, the otter is portrayed as an occasional messenger between humans and the creator. [79] Much has been written about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups – a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water [80] and attentively grooming its fur. Sea otter numbers have declined in … It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. Sedentary. [108], Another area of concern is California, where recovery began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Seals … Tool use is an unusual behavioral trait seen only in sea otters and a few other types of animals. [130] In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005 to 2014 at just under 3,000. [65] Females coo when they are apparently content; males may grunt instead. [120], In the late 1980s, the USFWS relocated about 140 southern sea otters to San Nicolas Island in southern California, in the hope of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. [155] Parasitic infections of Sarcocystis neurona are also associated with human activity. The hind feet, which provide most of its propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed.
