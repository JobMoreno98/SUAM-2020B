Also referred to as a rail wheel, it’s either cast or forged and is treated with heat to acquire a specific, desired toughness. This activity includes sudden braking, braking on steep gradients and braking with high weight loads. Some components shown are not the same, or are not present, on some locomotives – for example, on smaller or articulated types. The wheels on the train go round and round, Rolling down the tracks.
