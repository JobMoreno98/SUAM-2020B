Lactating females make trips of relatively short duration (12 h to a few days), which usually take them 10–20 km out to sea, but during the warm season trips last longer and the animals go further offshore. The harp seal is a fur-bearing northern seal of a different family (Phocidae). Under most circumstances, the boundaries of territories are fixed and are often delineated by natural breaks in the substrate. Proc. Two alliances occasionally even combine efforts to sequester or defend females from other alliances. This dependence on the vertical migration of their prey leads to strong variability in dive depth across the lunar cycle and also in numbers encountered ashore as most animals rest ashore during fullmoon nights and spend their time in the ocean during newmoon periods.         December 9, 2002 The abdomen is smaller, and tapers to the narrow pelvis. From Churchill, M., Boessenecker, R.W., and Clementz, M.T. They are fast and maneuverable swimmers and can seek refuge on land from these aquatic predators. Distribution The range of the two subspecies is disjunct. The average adult sex ratio is difficult to determine because a variable number of females will be at sea on any given day. Juan Fernandez fur seals were hunted to near extinction by sealers trading pelts in China. An adult female Juan Fernandez fur seal shows the long pointed muzzle of this species. Adult male Guadalupe fur seal in the water vigorously shaking. Larger, older, more experienced females generally have more access to favored rest sites, water, or shade than younger, smaller females. In all species, males defend space on the land sites that females use for giving birth and nursing their young (Riedman, 1990). Fat and energy content of milk is the highest of any member of the family Otariidae examined, allowing young to grow rapidly despite long periods of fasting. Climate and topography also play an important role in determining a male's mating success. Now, thanks to total protection, the Juan Fernandez fur seal is coming back. J. Linn. The individuals of this species do not dive very deeply, one study showing that females dive to an average of only 12.3m while feeding. Adult Guadalupe fur seal female with her pup in natal pelage. The hindflippers are long and each digit has a cartilaginous rod that adds a flap-like extension to each toe. Sexual dimorphism among otariids is correspondingly extreme; males are on average 3 times, and up to 10 times, heavier than females and have other traits favored in physical combat over females: large canines, heavy chests, and dense manes. Once territories are established, fighting between males is rare. Rather, by gathering on traditional mating grounds, the result is that males fight for access for these sites, and females subsequently mate with the winners of these contests. Soundings given. Juan Fernández Islands. Walker's mammals of the world. Territorial behavior that occurs in, or extends into, the water poses different challenges and shapes different agonistic strategies than tactics involved in mating on land. (1996) revealed that populations of harbor seals in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are highly differentiated. Iteroparous animals must, by definition, survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). Male seals compete for mates using a diverse catalog of aggressive behaviors, including violent fights that occasionally end in death. Each bull throws his weight against the other and slashes at his opponent’s face, neck, and back with long canines. While data from subpolar, tropical, and some temperate latitude species support the postulated cline, data for the temperate latitude Juan Fernández fur seal do not. 4). Many otariid seals including the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) shown here breed in colonies, in which individual males establish and defend territories. All species of Arctocephalus have similar coloration. Pups engage in play bouts that feature many of the components of adult aggressive behavior, sexual behavior, and prey handling in mixed order. In hot climates, females have more opportunity for mate choice due to their frequent thermoregulatory movements between their birthing site and the water. Bennett et al. The late Miocene colonization of the Southern Hemisphere by fur seals and sea lions (Carnivora: Otariidae). The Juan Fernández fur seal is found near isolated rocks and small islands off the coast of Chile in the Juan Fernández and San Félix/San Ambrosio island chain. Based on the onset of pupping and observations of vacated sites in early-September, pups of this species appear to be weaned at 7–10 months (Francis et al., 1998).

In California sea lions, the muzzle tapers to a blunt end, and the first toe or hallux is larger and longer than all of the other toes. Guadalupe fur seals were suspected to have survived based on scattered, unconfirmed reports in the 1930s, and were dramatically rediscovered again with the sighting of a bull on San Nicholas Island in southern California in 1949. Most virgin females mate on the same grounds as more mature females, but at the end of the breeding season. living in the southern part of the New World. Some male bearded seals in Alaska change from being territorial in 1 year to non-territorial in another (Van Parijs and Clark, 2006); in Svalbard, most males are territorial when land-fast ice is extensive. East San Benitos Island, Mexico. How successful these strategies are in inseminating females is generally not known. An expedition to Guadalupe Island in 1954 confirmed the survival of the species. Estrus occurs 5–10 days after a female gives birth, and females can leave for their first foraging trip right after mating, or stay on the colony for another few days before departing. Discovered by navigator Juan Fernández in the 16th century, the seals became a target for sealers in the Maritime Fur Trade era. They were rediscovered in the middle of the 20th century and have since been making a slow comeback. However, one episode of a bottlenose dolphin being rendered unconscious by repeated physical blows to his head was observed during an interaction of a male alliance with a “solo” male, suggesting that aggressive interactions can sometimes be severe, as well as pointing out the advantage of being at least a few individuals in an alliance (Parsons et al., 2003). Pups are born in a black natal coat that lightens to a dark brown, and they probably molt to a juvenile coat several months after birth. (Ochoa-Acuna, et al., 1999; Seal Conservation Society , 2001), The longevity of A. philippii is unknown but may be similar to A. gazella, in which expected life span is 13 years for males, with females typically living about 23 years. Gitas Jameikis Account Manager, West and North Michigan at John Crane West Palm Beach, Florida, United States 349 connections and is affected by environmental features that vary among sites even within a species (Fig. "Arctocephalus philippii" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. When physical contact occurs, it typically lasts a few seconds but it can also be violent, particularly in the largest sea lions. Vocal displays often precede and may prevent direct violence. The long muzzle tapers to a point and the fleshy end or “rhinarium” is large and the nostrils point downward at an angle. Males have a long pointed nose which is distinctive. Adult male Juan Fernandez fur seals are estimated to be 2 m long and weigh 140 kg. Land habitat for the, Aurioles-Gamboa and Camacho-Ríos, 2007; Pablo-Rodríguez et al., 2016, Marine Mammals of the World (Second Edition), PHOTOS: F. R. ELORRIAGA-VERPLANCKEN/CICIMAR-IPN, PHOTO: F. R. ELORRIAGA-VERPLANCKEN/CICIMAR-IPN, PHOTO: R. Elorriaga-Verplancken/CICIMAR-IPN, PHOTO: F. R. Elorriaga-Verplancken/CICIMAR-IPN, model of pinniped polygyny. Females maintain close spacing while on shore. Males attempt to intimidate each other with vocal displays that serve as individual signatures. In this mating scenario, multiple males compete for access to females, with none of them monopolizing mates. It is acknowledged that relationships among the latter group are poorly resolved. The southern group includes Antarctic, Galapagos, Guadalupe, Juan Fernandez, New Zealand, brown, South American, and subantarctic fur seals. Influence of long intersuckling interval on composition of milk in the Juan Fernandez fur seal, A. philippii. The Juan Fernández fur seal is endemic to Chile’s Juan Fernández and Desventuradas archipelagos and was hunted for its fur in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Steller sea lions, e.g., a female gains the sexual attention of a male by laterally swinging her neck, dragging her hindquarters and sinuous movements of her body against his body. They are only found on the Juan Fernández Islands and the Desventuradas Islands. "South African and Australian Fur Seals" Among the most distinguishing phocid characteristics is their inability to turn the hind limbs forward to support the body, resulting in a peculiar crawling locomotion on land or on ice (discussed further under Adaptations).
