When IR theorists stalk religion, they should do so critically. Seven leading cultural observers examine several regions and several religions and explain the resurgence of religion in world politics. Argues that far from being secularised, the "contemporary world is... furiously religious. Most people use words like ‘religion’ and ‘religious’ in everyday speech. What we can do, however, is rethink the way that we critically understand and deploy the concept of religion.[16]. Religion in everyday speech depends on the secular for its meaning. [7] For discussion, see Scott M. Thomas, The Global Resurgence of Religion and the Transformation of International Relations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), 21–69. [11] Daniel Philpott, ‘The Challenge of September 11 to Secularism in International Relations’, World Politics 55.1 (2002), 66–95. Find out more about E-IR’s open access books here. The Gay Science), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously declared: > “Gott is tot! Its universal claims to truth are transmuted as deeply felt personal convictions. Answering either one of those questions is difficult. The theoretical shift presumed by the religious resurgence speaks to the second challenge: integrating religion into existing theories of International Relations. He holds a BA in English from George Mason University and a PhD in Religious Studies from Boston University. [8] Daniel Philpott and Timothy Samuel Shah argue that the secularism of international relations theory is the product of the same historical transformation that created the modern world of sovereign states. [10] Kenneth D. Wald and Clyde Wilcox, ‘Getting Religion: Has Political Science Rediscovered the Faith Factor?’ American Political Science Review 100:4 (2006), 523–29. I hope it is clear at this juncture that religion is not the sort of concept that can be added and stirred into established theories. [6] For discussion, see William T. Cavanaugh, The Myth of Religious Violence (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), passim. The term “postsecular” has been used in sociology, political theory, religious studies, art studies, literary studies, education and other fields. Concepts can be reified—that is, they are insufficiently sensitive to the historical and social contexts in which particular religions develop. Cox reversed himself in Religion in the Secular City (1984), declaring that the future of religion lay in grassroots movements such as fundamentalism, Pentecostalism and liberation theology. Scholars in the field of Religious Studies have recognised this problem, and some advocate dispensing with the concept ‘religion’ altogether. [8] Religion asserting itself politically (as in the case of the Moral Majority in the United States or the Islamic Revolution in Iran) is seen as an anomaly. Gott bleibt tot! Now, Berger gathers a number of essays contending that, far from being in decline in the modern world, religion is actually experiencing a resurgence. [12] Quoted in Timothy Samuel Shah, ‘Religion and World Affairs: Blurring the Boundaries’, Rethinking Religion and World Affairs (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), 4. In this chapter I examine more closely the very notion of a ‘religious resurgence’ and its theoretical implications for International Relations (IR). [6] The only hope for lasting peace is to separate the religious sphere from the secular sphere (politics, the economy and public life, generally). Second, relevance is not determined by how popular and useful something seems to a generation wise in their own eyes. The first comes from the American Political Science Review. Not only is religion identified with Christianity, but the secular is originally a theological category unique to Western Christendom. [15] For one well-known argument in support of this position, see Timothy Fitzgerald, The Ideology of Religious Studies (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). It is the year when the wave of uprisings known as the Arab Spring, This type of social media was used by the activists opposing authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya to organize and disseminate information, The emergence of these cyber ghettos were refered to the various bubbles people place themselves in when they are online, This will be the biggest threat to faceasthe globalization of media deepens, Critiques of cultural imperialism began(year), Texts are received differently by varied interpretive communities (year), Splinternet and cyberbalkanization (year), Qttainment of goals through words(gospel), Ten commandments of christianity and Five Pillars for Islam, Supreme being is forgiving:one will get what gmhe deserves, He argued that far from being secularized, the "contemporary world is...furiously religious...", These are the foundations of modern republics, This has freed communities fron the constraints of nation-state but in the process, also threatened to destroy the cultural system that bind them together, Seeks to take the place of broken traditional ties to either help communities cope with their new situation or organizethem to oppose this major transformation of their lives, Gives communities a new and powerful basis of identity, It does not lead to identical responses from all religious actors, but sometimes globalization is actively pursued by religious actors, Group that oppose Westernization but are at the sane time products of this phenomenon even utilizing the tools and techniques to achieve their own globalizing aim, Has diverse, even pradoxical implications for religion, May have implied on faith in the following three possible impacts, Eroded, strengthened and declined but has developed new identities of hybridity, Give the three possible impacts of globalization implied on faith, Misunderstanding and misuse of Islamic principles derive mostly from this conception, Internal struggle to achieve self improvement, and external struggle to fight against injustice and social oppression through preaching and teaching, They use theconcept if Jihad to legitimatethe idea of armed Holy War, The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violenceby a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation, During this time, the term terrorism was first used to describe the actions of Jacobins, This was first used during French Revolution to describe the actions of Jacobins, In this century, the actions of terrorists were motivated by anarchism, They motivated the actions of terrorists in the 19th century, It was the main cause of the actions of terrorists in the 20th century, According to Allah that is stated in Quran, this has no place in Islam. E-IR is an independent non-profit publisher run by an all volunteer team. These two myths worked together (though colluded might be a better word) not only to separate politics from religion but also to make the particular historical terms of that separation normative for both politics and religion, generally. While it takes empirical form in a dizzying variety of ways, its core or essence can be concisely expressed in different systems of propositions and beliefs about reality. The years following 1980 are devoid of articles focused on religious factors, save one essay on American Government and two in Comparative Politics. This is an excerpt from Nations under God: The Geopolitics of Faith in the Twenty-First Century. Theorising Religion in International Relations. Is the world more religious than it ever has been before? Problems arise, however, when we try to define ‘religion’. First, religion is something that is ontologically unique—that is, religion is a transhistorical, transcultural object. In sorting ‘religious’ and ‘non-religious’ phenomena, we simply reproduce the normative claims specific to the category of modern religion—that is, religion is something sui generis standing in binary opposition to the secular. It’s not that ‘religion’ is indefinable; rather, ‘religion’ suffers from a sort of definitional satyriasis: no matter how many suitors there are, ‘religion’ is ready to accept another.  [2] My presentation of secularization as three interrelated social processes is indebted to Jose Casanova. The easiest way to do this would be, to use a cooking analogy, add and stir: add religion and stir it into already existing theories. For example, secularism becomes the new normal for politics. Realities Peter Berger argues that: • Far from being secularized, the contemporary world is….furiously religious. An important point to keep in mind is that both religion and the secular are historically located in European Latin Christendom. 9. See my ‘The Religious Resurgence and International Relations Theory’, Religious Studies Review 39.4 (2013), 201–21. A simple example would be the binary opposition ‘up’ and ‘down’. It is also a normative claim about the proper relationship between religion and politics. [5] The events of 11 September 2001 emphatically punctuated Berger’s claim that the world is as ‘furiously religious’ as ever. Stephen Dawson works at the intersection of religious studies, philosophy and the social sciences. [16] Since the 1980s, no scholar has been more influential in critically rethinking the concept of religion than Talal Asad. As a society modernises, religion loses its distinctive features—for instance, the public prominence and influence of religious institutions and leaders, the social utility of religion (as, say, a source of moral value), and epistemic claims to revelatory authority. If Proverbs teaches us anything, it is that fools feel quite justified in their self-destructive path, and openly scoff and mock the way of wisdom. Such upheaval was soon provided by real-life events, such as the election of the evangelical Christian Jimmy Carter to the White House, the mobilisation of conservative fundamentalists under the banner of the Moral Majority, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland. The key question begged by this strategy is, of course, whether religion is the sort of concept one can simply add and stir. and the upsurge of ethno-religious conflict in international affairs3. [9] Fundamentalism, for example, was envisioned as a new form of religion, the primary characteristic of which was opposition to modernity. Thus, widely utilised theories of International Relations, such as realism and liberalism, presume the absence of religion from the outset simply because religion is supposed to be outside politics. Currently he is Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at Lynchburg College in Lynchburg, Virginia. His current research focuses on the Thomist understanding of religion as a virtue embedded in a disciplinary program. [10] For the 100th anniversary issue (2006), Kenneth D. Wald and Clyde Wilcox surveyed the APSR archives and found that ‘prior to 1960 only a single APSR article sought to use religion as a variable to explain empirical phenomena’. This volume challenges the belief that the modern world is increasingly secular, showing instead that modernization more often strengthens religion. Beneath the sheer variety of competing definitions, however, two fundamental marks characteristic of the specifically modern category of religion can be discerned. This means that a whole body of literature written by historians and social scientists over the course of the 1950s and The religious resurgence is at once a return of religion to global politics as well as to International Relations theory. Television was turning the world into what? The democratic potential of social media was most evident in what year? Problems with the modern category of religion become apparent when scholars attempt to use religion as an analytic or descriptive category. The world is as furiously religious as it ever was.” Furiously is perhaps the operative word here. 			bandwidth bills to ensure we keep our existing titles free to view. in a secularized world is false: The world today, with some exceptions attended to below, is as furiously religious as it ever was, and in some places more so than ever. [13] In short, the roots of the religion–secular binary run deep in the Western tradition. [17] For three examples of the skilful integration of religion into International Relations analysis, see Elizabeth Shakman Hurd, The Politics of Secularism in International Politics (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007); Daniel H. Nexon, ‘Religion and International Relations: No Leap of Faith Required’, Religion and International Relations Theory; and Thomas, The Global Resurgence of Religion and the Transformation of International Relations. After clarification of insufficiency and unnecessity of secularization for modernization, it is the time … Before you download your free e-book, please consider donating to Many thanks! Some of these attempts clear new ground; others succumb to a variety of problems. There are other ways, however, to integrate religion into IR theory and analysis. How (Not) to Theorise Religion and International Relations, Religious Movements and Religion’s Contribution to Global Civil Society, Sociotheology: The Significance of Religious Worldviews, A Balanced Perception of Religion in International Relations. Takeaways. Some provide genealogies of religion: Peter Harrison, ‘Religion’ and the Religions in the English Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002 [1990]); Brent Nongbri, Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013); Guy G. Stroumsa, A New Science: The Discovery of Religion in the Age of Reason (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2010). The secularisation thesis - the idea that traditional religions are in terminal decline in the industrialised world - was perhaps the central debate in the sociology of religion in the second half of the 20th century. In his 1882 work Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft (i.e. Secularism is a defining characteristic of the "Modern" world -- so why is there such an increase in religious belief? By the 1980s, Harvey Cox had renounced his own thesis. The world today “is as furiously religious as it ever was, and in some places more than ever.” Though modernity has secularizing effects it has provoked powerful movements of counter-secularization. For this reason, secularisation is ‘twinned’, as it were, to the process of modernisation. At first glance the word ‘religion’ seems relatively straightforward. In most of the world, there are veritable explosions of religious fervor, occurring in one for, of another in all the major religious traditions - Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even Confucianism - and in many places imaginative syntheses of one or more world religions with indigenous faith." Available now on Amazon (UK, USA), in all good book stores, and via a free PDF download. It’s not exactly clear, however, what this observation means. [14] What is more, rogue concepts have a strong tendency to enfold normative assumptions and commitments into scholarly analysis by continued uncritical application. These two concepts no longer simply describe human phenomena; rather, they distinguish normal and abnormal varieties. While religious, political, and ethnic conflicts continue, we are currently living in one of the most peaceful eras in the history of the planet. Peter Berger made a turnaround, too, culminating in his 1999 book, The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics. The concept of secularisation does not simply describe a historical process. Five thick volumes issued from the Project before it ended in 1995. It’s quite possible that the world looks different simply because social scientists and other scholars have removed their secularisation goggles. Some other scholars have built on Asad’s work. Donations are voluntary and not required to download the e-book - your link to download is below. In a phrase indelibly linked with Max Weber, secularisation would end in a ‘disenchanted’ world, or a world largely free of religion. [1] Since the 1960s, Berger was renowned as one of the leading proponents of the secularisation thesis. A number of books have been published in the past ten years on the conviction widely shared by scholars across a variety of disciplines that we are currently experiencing a worldwide religious resurgence. Second, in order to be known, religion requires the epistemological contrast of ‘not-religion’, or the secular. First, one way to understand the religious resurgence is in terms of a theoretical shift: as IR scholars move beyond the secularisation thesis, religion becomes more obvious as a variable in global politics. This has freed communities fron the constraints of nation-state but in the process, also threatened to … After reviewing these developments, Peter L. Berger, one of the foremost advocates of secularization during the 1960s, recanted his earlier claims: “The world today, with some exceptions…is as furiously religious as it ever was, and in some places more so than ever. [9] A good example of this is provided by the Fundamentalist Project, a well-funded, multi-year research project under the direction of Martin Marty that examined the phenomena of “fundamentalism” across religious traditions. Once that happens, the analysis is, in a manner of speaking, possessed. But today, much of the world is as religious as ever. This is why Berger, in a 1968 interview in the New York Times, confidently predicted that, by ‘the twenty-first century, religious believers are likely to be found only in small sects, huddled together to resist a world-wide secular culture’. Religion and the Modern World Stage. José Casanova delivered the 2018 Edward Cadbury Lectures at the University of Birmingham, which are now formally published in the new reference journal Brill Research Perspectives in Religion and Politics.Over a series of four talks titled “Global Religious and Secular Dynamics,” Casanova discussed the relationships between secularization, religion, and globalization in the modern world. He explains how religions have evolved over time and how they are reacting to the challenges posed by new scientific and moral beliefs. A celebration of the diversity in the world's religions, Ward's timely book also deals with the possibility and necessity of religious tolerance and co-existence. With respect to traditional religion (and traditional ways of life, for that matter), modernisation acts like a solvent.
