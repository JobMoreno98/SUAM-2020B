[90] "She's Got Nothing On (But the Radio)" was released in January 2011, becoming a substantial hit in mainland Europe,[91] and their highest-peaking single in Germany since 1992's "How Do You Do!". [25], Fredriksson's third studio album, ... Efter stormen (English: After the Storm), was issued in October 1987. She was the artist of Roxette and was known for having one of the most unmistakable voices of the 1980s and 90s pop. Marie Fredriksson, who as the singer of Roxette was one of the most recognisable voices in 1980s and 90s pop, has died aged 61 following a long illness. [5] She also credited her pastor with encouraging her love of music, and said that she had been performing "ever since I was little and me and my sister Tina went to Sunday school. [3] Three years later, her oldest sister Anna-Lisa was involved in a fatal traffic collision; her car was crushed by a tanker truck while she was travelling to purchase a dress for her engagement party. [101] However, these concerts were cancelled after Fredriksson was advised by her doctors to cease all touring activity, due to poor health. [55] She issued a box set containing all of her previous studio albums, Kärlekens guld (Love's Gold), in June 2002. This close relationship between the two bands resulted in Fredriksson performing vocals on Gyllene Tider's 1981 song "Ingenting av vad du behöver" (English: "Nothing of What You Need"). Cause of Death, and Funeral The well-known Swedish singer, Marie Fredriksson, has died at the age of 61 after battling with cancer on the 9 th of December 2019. When she was four years old, her parents sold their farm and relocated to Östra Ljungby, where Gösta took a job as a postman and Inez became a factory worker. [7], While Fredriksson had established herself as a prominent soloist, Gessle's solo work struggled to replicate the success of Gyllene Tider; his second studio album Scener (1985) sold less than 20,000 copies, a significant drop from the 400,000 copies sold by Moderna tider four years earlier. Marie Fredriksson the performer had grown in stature, at the expense of Marie the private person. [4] On 21 October 2005, Fredriksson conducted an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, saying: "It's been three very difficult years, [but] I'm healthy. [7], After graduating from music school in 1977, Fredriksson moved to Halmstad, where she worked in theatre before becoming involved in the local indie music scene. I loved all the songs. [37] The single's parent album eventually sold over 9 million copies worldwide. Marie Fredriksson was born on May 30, 1958 in Östra Ljungby, Skåne län, Sweden as Gun-Marie Fredriksson. Fredriksson was best known as the lead vocalist, keyboardist and co … After collapsing in her home in september 2002, she was admitted to Karolinska hospital (Sweden) where the doctors discovered a brain tumour. [35][36] "The Look" topped the chart after just eight weeks,[32] and went on to peak at number one in a total of 25 countries. "[55], Her first greatest hits album, Äntligen – Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984–2000, was released in 2000, and was the second best-selling album of the year in Sweden, behind the Beatles compilation 1. The concert was broadcast in its entirety five days later on Sveriges Television. [7] Den sjunde vågen (English: The Seventh Wave) was released in February 1986 and peaked at number six on Sverigetopplistan, selling over 90,000 copies. [26] The non-album single "Sparvöga" ("Sparrow-eye") was recorded as the theme music for a miniseries of the same name,[7] and became both her highest-peaking and best-selling single to date when it was issued in February 1989. [8] She formed punk group Strul (English: Hassle) in 1978 with then-boyfriend Stefan Dernbrant—the band consisted of an extensive and fractious lineup of musicians, the majority of whom would leave after a single performance; Per Gessle and Mats Persson of Gyllene Tider (English: Golden Ages) were briefly members. [7] The album was successful in Sweden,[13] and she joined Lindbom's band as a featured vocalist for an extensive tour of the country. [24] Their debut album, Pearls of Passion, was a major success upon release in October 1986, peaking at number two and eventually selling over 200,000 copies,[22] but it failed to chart internationally. She had it surgically removed and has since undergone radiation therapy for cancer.
