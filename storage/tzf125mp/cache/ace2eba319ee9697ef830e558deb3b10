Our theme song is by Robyn, original music is composed by Carolyn Pennypacker Riggs, our logos are by Kenesha Sneed, our associate producer is Destry Maria Sibley. Fortunately, Rebecca Traister's work on the political power of women's anger is always timely, as we revisit our 2018 interview. All the members take pseudonyms after dead women artists. . And what dreams of the past and future are getting us through the pandemic? It's documenting the world. I keep mixing them up. Are they using particular colors?

Everybody knows or everybody should know that you can't bring a plus one to the wedding if you haven't talked to the people about it, right? And this is something that I think comes up all semester long with every class I teach, just with photography in general, is just that people still see them as this window to the world, as this like little bit of reality, not as like something that's authored. And I would love to hear you talk a little bit more about the history of what we've been trained to take pictures of and want to share because that's not something that, as you point out, photography at this level is new. Especially when it's an issue as challenging as homelessness? A brief discussion of the Supreme Court nomination of  the Judge Handmaiden. And you can even insert your own speculum at the gynecologist if that makes you more comfortable. Okay, not who she is but what in the photo is making you read chill?

I mean maybe it's like the multi-photo slideshow of having the next photo be like hello, here is my bank account from 2013 and this is where I -- you know what I mean? Ann: A podcast for long-distance besties everywhere. Aminatou: But when I see that the first thing that always comes to mind is like great composition. For friend of the podcast and artist Kenesha Sneed, that has meant moving among media and the many different roles her art has played in her life - from joyful personal expression to income-generating job to outlet for grief. . Ann: It is really just the trickery of capitalism for literally decades and decades and decades.

So I think yeah, we have to kind of be aware of how this is working on us. I am hearing what you're saying. Co-hosted by BFFs Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow. Are we getting the full context? This is a skill I've used more with Twitter than Instagram where as soon as I start feeling like I kind of want to jump out of my skin or I start feeling bad about myself which is a thing that happens once I hit a certain hour point on social media . We’re reading fiction, nonfiction, essays and anxiety-producing novels. We’re reading fiction, nonfiction, essays and anxiety-producing novels. I love Instagram accounts where I learn something.

We revisit our 2019 interview full of hard and candid truths about what she was and wasn't able to accomplish, especially in Syria. Lara: Totally, yeah. You know, that's where they're at and they don't know what's going on and we're being manipulated all the time. I want to be a journalist like her." Aminatou: @ifyouhigh. A year ago we were working on making portraits as their studio project and I was like in conjunction with this why don't you choose a person on Instagram who's like a public persona or a company that has an Instagram persona and talk about the way they're using photography to develop that persona and portray it? Would I have dinner with you alone at my house? Here's another new intimate space that I'm not a part of.

A person in my extended friend group Niki Ford has a great Instagram account called Niki Ford Cooks which is just like little kitchen tips and good recipes. I don't even want to be Oprah.
