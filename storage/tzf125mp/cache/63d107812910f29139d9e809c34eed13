Loss of cardiomyocytes is a major cause of heart failure, and while the adult heart has a limited capacity for cardiomyogenesis, little is known about what regulates this ability or whether it can be effectively harnessed. Lee is Leader of the Cardiovascular Diseases Program of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. We also demonstrate that fructose consumption induces expression of Txnip in the small intestine. View the profiles of people named Richard Lee. Metabolic studies suggest that the absorptive capacity of the small intestine for fructose is limited, though the molecular mechanisms controlling this process remain unknown. New cardiomyocytes are identified based on incorporation of N-thymidine by multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) and on being mononucleate/diploid. Dr. Lee has published over 270 peer-reviewed articles based on his research, and teaches undergraduates at Harvard College. Finally, we will evaluate legal and business issues necessary to move scientific and technical innovations from the laboratory to the patient. Numerous studies have revealed that nerves are crucial for organ regeneration, thus we aimed to determine whether nerves guide heart regeneration.

Publication Date: 01/01/1976. Other studies suggest that new cardiomyocytes are born at a very low rate, and that they may be derived from the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. When Richard Henry Lee’s resolution was presented on June 7, 1776, it called for these three things, in this order: That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be totally dissolved. Diabetic mice had increased expression of Txnip in the small intestine as well as enhanced fructose uptake and transport into the hepatic portal circulation.

Some organisms, such as adult zebrafish and newborn mice, have the capacity to regenerate heart tissue following injury. Arrestin proteins and metabolism: We investigate how the alpha arrestins, a family of conserved proteins, regulate mammalian metabolism. These findings demonstrate that cardiomyogenesis can be activated by exercise in the normal and injured adult mouse heart and suggest that stimulation of endogenous cardiomyocyte generation could contribute to the benefits of exercise. These findings demonstrate that nerve function is required for both zebrafish and mouse heart regeneration. Here we show, by combining two different pulse-chase approaches--genetic fate-mapping with stable isotope labelling, and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry--that the genesis of cardiomyocytes occurs at a low rate by the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes during normal ageing, a process that increases adjacent to areas of myocardial injury.
