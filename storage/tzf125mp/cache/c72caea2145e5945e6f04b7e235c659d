NC State will finish this year with a winning record and meet the traditional eligibility standard for a bowl trip, but remember that the NCAA waived the win requirement this year, so … [114][115], In 2009, the Wolfpack posted wins over Pittsburgh of the Big East[119] and a third-straight win over North Carolina,[120] but was decimated by injuries and finished the season 5–7. While most Power Five programs will be bowl eligible this season regardless of record due, NC State solidified bowl eligibility two weeks ago with a win over Liberty. [15] A win over Virginia Tech in Norfolk that season was dubbed the "biggest game ever played in the South". During Rein's four years at NC State, he led the team to two bowl games, defeating Iowa State in the 1977 Peach Bowl and defeating the Pittsburgh in the 1978 Tangerine Bowl. [14], The team won a second South Atlantic championship in 1910 under coach Edward Green, finishing with a record of 4–0–2. North Carolina State's 2021 season schedule includes their next game in 143 days. [33] That season was followed by a 3–6–1 campaign in 1948,[34] a 3–7 mark in 1949[35] and a 5–4–1 record in 1950. NC State boasted a 2–0 record against the Fighting Irish, winning both of their meetings up to that time by a combined score of 38–9. 19 Florida State. [45] Edwards produced eight All-Americans: Dick Christy, halfback (1957),[46] Roman Gabriel, quarterback (1960, 1961),[47] Don Montgomery, defensive end (1963),[48] Dennis Byrd, defensive tackle (1966, 1967),[49] Fred Combs, defensive back (1967),[50] Gerald Warren, kicker (1967),[51] Ron Carpenter, defensive tackle (1968),[51] and Cary Metts, center, (1968). [13] The game aired on the now-defunct Dumont Television Network. Prior to joining the ACC in 1953, the Wolfpack were a member of the Southern Conference. [13] In addition to Pullen Park, the state fairgrounds had hosted some games prior to the opening of the new stadium. NC State Wolfpack football finished the 2020 regular season 8-3 overall and 7-3 in ACC play. RALEIGH, N.C. - NC State's football team will ring in the New Year in the Sunshine State, as the Wolfpack has been selected to play in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl. [78][80] Kiffin decided to leave NCSU after three seasons to pursue coaching opportunities in the NFL. [116] The bid to the Papajohns.com Bowl marked the ninth bowl invitation in the past 10 years for O'Brien. Kentucky runs for 281, beats NC State 23-21 in chippy Gator — A.J. After not qualifying for postseason play in Doeren’s first season in Raleigh, the Pack has earned bowl eligibility in each of the previous three years, going 2-1 and outscoring its opponents 103-95. [177] The NC State and East Carolina rivalry dates back to the first meeting between the two schools in 1970, when they began playing on an annual basis which lasted until 1987. [55] Things didn't pan out for Michaels, as the Wolfpack compiled a 3–8 record in his only year as head coach. NC State Wolfpack football is 7-3 overall and 6-3 in ACC play after ten games in 2020. It’s the third time in four bowl games N.C. State will be matched up with an SEC team. [138], The next year, Doeren's team finished 7–6,[139] losing the 2015 Belk Bowl. NC State will appear in its 31st bowl game in program history on Dec. 29 as it takes on Arizona State in the Sun Bowl 2014 St. Petersburg Bowl. [81] State struggled under Reed's leadership, posting three consecutive 3–8 yearly records en route to a 9–24 overall mark. North Carolina State - Greg Golden 90 yard kick return (Kiker kick), 3:48, 2nd; Pittsburgh - Rutherford 1 yard run (Lotz kick), :20, 2nd; Pittsburgh - Lotz 33 yard field goal, 10:22, 3rd; North Carolina State - Rivers-Edwards 5 yard pass (kick failed), 14:56, 4th; North Carolina State - Kiker 19 yard field goal, 9:39, 4th [121][114][115], After being picked to finish fourth in the Atlantic Division in the preseason in 2010,[122] the Wolfpack finished with a record of 9–4 and tied for second in the ACC,[123] was one game away from playing for an ACC title and was the third league team picked in the bowl selections. [19] The program, led by coach Harry Hartsell at the time, joined the Southern Conference that year[19] and would win the conference title six seasons later under coach Gus Tebell, finishing the year with a 9–1 record. The team lost to Oklahoma, 34–13,[32] and finished the season at 8–3,[31] the highest win total since finishing 9–1 in 1927. This includes three appearances in the 1970s, two in the 1980s and two in the 1990s. [129] She was concerned over lagging season-ticket sales, as well as his approach to recruiting. [95] Although Amato had no head coaching or coordinating experience, NCSU felt that Amato's 18-year tenure as defensive line coach under Bobby Bowden at Florida State, winning two national championships, would help boost recruiting, ticket sales, and program prestige. Last year’s 41-17 victory marked the third-largest margin of victory (+24 points) in State’s bowl history. The stadium's seating capacity is 57,583. [141] For the 2016 season, the Wolfpack again finished 7–6. The first hot streak began in 1972, where it appeared in six of a possible seven bowls from then until 1978, including four straight from 1972-75. After Rein's departure, NC State hired Arkansas defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, father of Ole Miss and former Florida Atlantic, Oakland Raiders, Tennessee and USC head coach Lane Kiffin,[77] as head coach. Fast-forward to this year and State will be appearing in a bowl game for the eighth time in the past 10 seasons (2008-17), tied for the most in a 10-year span in school history (see previous eight in nine-year span from 1986-94). In terms of mileage, the Sun Bowl will be the second-farthest from Raleigh in State history, clocking in at 1,820 miles away. Get a recap of the West Virginia Mountaineers vs. NC State Wolfpack football game. [130] However, NCSU ended up only having to pay O'Brien $200,000 after the buyout was renegotiated so he could become an assistant at Virginia. [86], Mike O'Cain was promoted from quarterbacks coach to head coach after Sheridan's retirement. [88], The latter part of O'Cain's tenure saw mostly mediocre teams. [174], The two teams will next play during the 2021 season in Winston-Salem. 12 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking in 29 years.[98][97].

[171], NC State has retired or honored the jersey number of 11 former players. [24]  Recruitment became difficult during at least part of his tenure as head coach due to the fact that World War II necessitated that eligible males over 18 be inducted into the U.S. In 1979, it became Carter–Finley Stadium, named after Albert E. Finley, another major philanthropist and contributor to the university. However, the last two years haven’t been kind in these regards, as last year’s win over Vanderbilt was in Shreveport, Louisiana and this year’s is staged in El Paso. One of the most famous Wolfpack wins came in the … The 2021 TaxSlayer Gator Bowl kicks off at 12pm ET on January 2 in Jacksonville, FL. Rose ran for a career-high 148 yards, Chris Rodriguez added 84 yards and two scores and Kentucky held off No. Then, almost like clockwork, State put up another hot streak, qualifying for eight of a possible nine bowl games from 1986-94. The Wolfpack will match up with Kentucky, which finished the season at 4-6. His 1995 and 1996 teams finished with 3–8 records,[89][90] and although the Wolfpack improved to finish 6–5,[91] 7–5[92] and 6–6[93] the next three years, he went 0–7 against archrival North Carolina. On September 16, 2010, NC State restored the tradition of having a live mascot on the field. Additionally, the Pack has been a part of this bowl two times in a three-year span on two separate occasions: in 1975 and 1977, as well as 1986 and 1988. [52] Though Edwards' tenure wasn't overly successful from a record standpoint, it was the most successful tenure of any head coach to that point and laid the foundation for future successes to occur. [170] While being members of separate divisions in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the two teams are designated as cross-over rivals, and thus play each other every year. [171], NC State leads 67–41–6 through the 2020 season. Amato's tenure in Raleigh crested after Rivers graduated and left for the NFL. The game will be the 33rd bowl game in N.C. State history and its fifth trip to the Gator Bowl. Against the Mountaineers, the Pack still holds the bowl record for its rushing yards in a game, amassing a whopping 337, including three rushing touchdowns by Stan Fritts, which also still holds a bowl record for State. O'Brien's squad was the first Wolfpack team to garner nine wins since 2003 posted State's first winning season in five years. [158]:150–156[159], † Co-champion In Feathers' second season, Wolfpack defensive player Howard "Touchdown" Turner returned an interception 105 yards against Duke, a record that still stands as the longest play in Wolfpack history. As a founding member of the ACC, the Wolfpack has won seven conference championships and participated in 31 bowl games, of which the team has won 17, including eight of their last 11.  Prior to joining the ACC in 1953, the Wolfpack were a member of the Southern Conference. [12] The Farmers played their home games that season on campus at the New Athletic Park, which would later be known as Riddick Stadium. [69] Despite winning the conference title, the Wolfpack were not invited to a bowl–as of the end of the 2019 season, the last bowl-eligible conference champion from a power conference to not take part in a bowl game. Under coach Mickey Whitehurst, A&M won the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship with a 6–0–1 record. [146] NC State would then lose four games in a row, first in a heartbreaker against No. Since 1966, the Wolfpack has played its home games at Carter–Finley Stadium. [45], His teams won five Atlantic Coast Conference titles and made two Liberty Bowl appearances. [11] That season, the program also recorded its first ever victory over Virginia. [20] Running back Jack McDowall was the team's star player that year.
