He has also threatened O'Hara with arrest if he did not leave their rooms immediately. No More Parades also further develops the beautifully complicating fact that Sylvia feels some love towards Tietjens despite her frustrations with him, and that he perhaps has feelings for her beyond simply duty or parade.

Instead, he’s entirely preoccupied with the issues with his marriage. Meanwhile, Campion has temporarily suspended O'Hara as chief of the Garrison Police and has given Perowne a choice between rejoining his regiment at the front or a court-martial. Levin offers to help Tietjens with his problems, which disgusts Tietjens completely:  he would  “rather be dead than an open book”—that is, rather be dead, as O Nine Morgan is, than expose his marital life to the small world that surrounds him.

She doesn't seem to know what she wants or how she feels. Colonel Levin, acting for General Campion, speaks to Tietjens, whom General O'Hara has placed under arrest, about events of the early hours of the morning—events that took place about 3:00 a.m.  Tietjens had thrown Perowne bodily out of Sylvia's bedroom and had also ejected O'Hara from it as he insisted on seeing her partially naked.

That is something Ford Madox Ford is quite emphatic about; this war is the end of life as it used to be, and there will be no more parades of any kind—not military, not marital. Sylvia's supposed purpose in coming to Rouen is to have Christopher sign a document, which requires no signature, that gives her the legal right to live at Groby, his family's ancestral home in Yorkshire, and makes their son Michael successor to it. But I did love it. She doesn't seem to know what she wants or how she feels. No More Parades, the section of Parade ’s End I finished this past week, covers only a little over 200 pages but at some point I found a deeper appreciation for what Ford accomplishes.

This second novel picks up exactly where the last left off, and so while this is a series of novels, they’re usually packaged together in one edition. The subject was the world as it culminated in the war; the story centers on Christopher Tietjens, an officer and gentleman, the last English Tory, and follows him from the secure, orderly world of Edwardian England into the chaotic madness of the First World War.

It sets forth the maddening chaos that is war, from the meddling of civilians who have no knowledge or care of how much pain and disaster their meddling will cause to the destruction of relationships and lives brought on by the stress of war. Sylvia Tietjen's character is complex and difficult. Book two of Parade's End was a little hard to get into at first. She is the most terrible person I ever read about. The omissions in her case are fully, and maliciously, intentional, and serve to portray more graphically than words the scenes evokcd in her mind. This one is much more dependent on the other three novels of the tetrology than the novel preceding it, Some Do Not. Ford could write, there’s no doubt. New York : Grosset & Dunlap, [1928], ©1925 Campion gets everything straight about Christopher and Sylvia. Tietjens therefore gets the same treatment as Perowne:  a choice between court-martial or the trenches. She makes assumptions about her husband he makes them about her but they lack the h. I found the beginning to be confusing, following Tietjen's train of thought and conversations was difficult with them being so disjointed and repetetive but I understand Ford's reasoning behind it. There’s an interesting kind of fatalism about his time in war, not that he’ll die in combat or experience the adventures of war in other novels like A Farewell to Arms or All Quiet on the Western Front. If I’m honest, I can’t say I really enjoyed them, in that immersive kind a way I hanker after - asides from a few chapters, that is; especially the first two in No More Parades.

Sylvia further complicates her husband's life by flirting with General O'Hara, who foolishly thinks that she is inviting him to be her lover. As you might say: No flowers by compulsion...No more parades!...He had also to explain, while he did it, to the heroic veterinary sexagenarian that he need not feel shy about going into the Glamorganshire Mess on a man-catching expedition.

I am getting more into this set of 4 books and found this second one more easily read and understood. I will probably do a longer review when I have finished the entire Parade’s End sequence (if anyone cares). Its suddenness was something surprising, the mournful cheerful, long notes dying regretfully on a night that had only just gone quiet after the perfectly astonishing row. No More Parades is the second novel of Ford Madox Ford's highly regarded tetralogy about the First World War, Parade's End. Moreover, General Lord Edward Campion, Tietjens’ godfather, has assigned to his godson's staff the shell-shocked and intermittently mad, though highly decorated, Captain McKechnie, a classical scholar and proud of it.

For instance, Levin's marriage to Mlle de Bailly had been stalled by a "disagreeable duchess" who objected to the price of coal for her hothouses, which Christopher solved by having coal from his own estate sent to her at the pit price it sold for on the day before the war began. There are two things that Tietjens cannot escape from. Things come to a head when husband Christopher, former lover Perowne and another officer converge on Sylvia's hotel room.
