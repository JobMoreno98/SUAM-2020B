Unfortunately, I felt that most of his best performances happened in amongst some of his worst performances in the middle of the split. Last week, all eyes were on Cloud9 vs. On those two aforementioned games, he had more than 1/4 of his total regular season deaths, and overall he tied for the most deaths among supports in the league. However, they will remain favourites heading into the finals despite their poor performances in recent weeks. With that being said though, I do think he had some weaknesses compared to some of the others. For me, the reason he is ranked 7th, is because frankly no other support in the league looked as bad as he did. Find our dedicated section to the LCS here. They can generally win lanes, but are fairly inconsistent in doing so and fall prone to some of Wildturtle's overly aggressive tendencies. I think if you are going to have Iconic and Niles come into the league with the lack of experience they have, and have Ablazeolive just make the move up from academy, you need to make sure that your bot lane has the leadership that your team lacks. However, towards the end, even Huhi's strength began to wane until only FBI was left. This man was my frontrunner for a lot of the split. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, and it more reflects on Ignar's weaknesses in his ability to play with an ADC that doesn't make massive sacrifices to enable him. LCS Proving Grounds 2021 Spring live results, schedules, VODs, streams, and news coverage. After the 2021 LCS Spring Split All-Pro teams were announced, Cloud9 was awarded Coaching Staff of the Split simultaneously with the top 10 nominees reveal for the Honda Most Valuable Player award.

Cookie Policy. Where Cloud9 and 100Thieves saw dips in their performance at the end of the split, and TSM saw consistent inconsistency, TL saw a gradual rise from the middle of the pack, which is unexpected for the Lockin champions, but expected for a team whose players had visa issues. Whilst I do think CoreJJ was the best support this split, I think he was far from the unreachable talent that he has been in previous splits. The LCS 2021 Spring Season is the first split of the ninth year of North America's professional League of Legends league. Christmas is gone, New Year’s Eve is behind us, which can only mean one thing: that it’s time for the 2021 League of Legends season, and in order for you to perform admirably in your LCS & LEC combined Fantasy leagues, we’ve got you covered with all the expert opinions and angles to help you outplaying your league opponents! He seemed much more comfortable playing around some of the other previous Cloud9 members, which kind of makes sense given their history together. The odds below represent the head-to-head matchups for teams on 10 April 2021 in the LEC 2021 Spring. I even think I would have called him an MVP candidate earlier on and that's because Huhi had his death note and was writing names. They decided to get a somewhat unproven talent as their support, when what they really needed was more veteran leadership on the roster. Since then, what I have seen is a largely good but not amazing support player, and that TSM's teamwork was coming together quite well. I don't think Johnsun played particularly well this split either, so I think a large reason I liked these picks is that it made Johnsun somewhat useful in many of the games that he may not have found much access to fights. Despite this, I do think Ignar, whilst still being slightly over-aggressive at times, has managed to temper his playstyle a little bit to match what Evil Geniuses needs. The League of Legends European Championship and the League of Legends Championship Series are the game’s European and North American domestic leagues. A very eventful offseason found us with a lot of new look rosters. As many expected, Mid-laner Luka “Perkz” Perković stepped up for the big games with superb showings throughout.

Team Liquid and TSM will clash in an electric best-of-five before the victor challenges C9 with the LCS title on the line. Ignar has kind of sat around this level for most of the split. His decisions didn't feel like they had much direction and felt half baked. I think he has looked like an individually stellar player for CLG across the split, and in my opinion is the best Rell in the league. A support who leads fights for example is more likely to be judged on their engagements.                  |  Once the Swede returned to traditional AD Carries, G2 took a game back but even that couldn’t stop MAD in Game 4 who continued to play team fights beautifully. Both are mistakes. Overall I do think he has seen a pretty dramatic decline from his performances from last year. The star-studded roster won Game 2 with one of the most dominant showings we’ve seen during the Mid-Season Showdown so far. Ranking supports in my opinion is the hardest role to possibly rank, and I think the core analytics behind rankings supports comes from this idea of whether they fulfilled their purpose and how well they managed to do so. The goal was quite simple: to gauge and estimate the strength of each competing team and, in doing so, attempt to predict the way things will resolve once all is said and done. I think the one reason I put him down a little on this list, was the obvious champion pool weaknesses that became glaringly obvious in the last week where people started banning Alistar. What is the difference between LoL and Dota 2? I think Aphromoo's story doesn't get told nearly enough considering he is definitively one of NA's GOAT supports. Mid-split hopefuls: 100 Thieves, TSM, Dignitas. In the end, it was a rather simple 3-1 victory for C9 who are now heavy favourites to lift the title. Rookie Adrian "Trymbi" Trybus admitted that nerves got the better of him during his first games on stage against MAD Lions the week prior but the Polish support appears to have moved past that as his phenomenal engage won his team the series 3-1. Cloud9 fans can rest easy because none of these games took place in the Mid Season Showdown. Smoothie will prove crucial to their overall development and I eagerly anticipate his performances next split. Six teams remain in contention with only five Mid-season Showdown berths up for grabs. I understand there are budget limitations to this roster, but even figures like Zeyzal and Hakuho would have been much better fits for this org. Overall I am not going to lie, I did have several other supports in mind for first place earlier in the split. Comparing him to Smoothie, seeing as they each have the same score, I would say Smoothie was more prone to having games with very little impact, but also had a lot of huge moments and generally laned better than Ignar, where Ignar played a little more consistently with fewer upsides or downsides. A support who is supposed to protect their backline will be judged more on the their ability to protect. The 2021 LCS Spring Split is right around the corner, which means it’s time for our 2021 LCS Spring Split Power Rankings! G2 Esports. If everything falls into place, they have the individual talent, the veteran leadership and have all had great moments this split reminiscent of some of their career best plays. This will be MAD’s first-ever final. At their peak in Summer, CLG will be a force to be reckoned with, and I think the proof lies in their ability to take wins off of C9 and TL. The LCS Proving Grounds Spring 2021 is the first proving grounds circuit for North American League of Legends, allowing any team to compete against the LCS academy teams. That victory was a 24-minute stomp and will give Liquid a strong platform to build from during this crucial week of practice. I think Destiny ranks this low because he was really high variance. Unlike previous years, records carry over into Summer.. Overview [] Format []. If it sounds harsh, I don't really mean it to be so bad, but I think this is a player who needs time to develop with a few more veterans around him to show him what to do. Like the top lane rankings that preceded this, I will be going further in depth on my analysis. But, neither of their opponents should be underestimated. Team Liquid looked dominant across all phases of the competition as CoreJJ lead the team to victory in a relatively easy back-to-back series. There wasn't a single week to single out where you could point to Aphromoo and say that he caused Dignitas to lose, yet with every single one of their 11 wins he was the backbone for this roster. They proceeded to promptly answer those questions as they camped the Welshman and found three kills on him within the first 15 minutes of the opening game. Top 4 teams start in the upper bracket Find a full list of odds for the LCS 2021 here. I think the raw strength of Smoothie has come back again in a big way this split. His protective style of play tended to ensure that Flyquest's bot lane would lose with grace, but he was generally okay at this playstyle, even going later into the game. His score is more of a judgement of who he is, and not what there could have been, so whilst I seem very negative, it is mostly around the players that I felt should have been there instead to help the development of this roster. LCS Spring 2021 stats: Team ranking, Top KDA, picks and bans. New year, new luck for North American League of Legends? In the latter parts of the split, we saw less of those nasty outplays.

Golden Guardians are all-in on the Stixxay strategy, and it’s a respectable effort. When week 4 and 5 rolled around, I think that's when I really noticed his play take a dip. He had fewer misplays in these games, and generally wasn't the reason for IMT's failure to get into playoffs, but I think we could have seen more down the stretch. Despite winning against Cloud9 in the last week, Smoothie's next two games were far less impressive against Evil Geniuses and Golden Guardians, which is why he took a slight dip on the last week, one that would overall prove important to his ability to be in my top 5. To be frank, Fnatic were a mess while Schalke dominated them across the map. In the first two games, G2 continued to experiment with enchanters in the Bot-lane but Martin “Rekkles” Larsson’s Karma was nowhere near as effective as his Seraphine. Player vs. Coach – The success behind “Faker” and Brady, Ascending to God status: Gilius has one more miracle run to make, The revolution that fixed Fnatic’s identity crisis, League of Legends World Championship preview. Should G2 be victorious, they will break their own record for the most consecutive LEC titles, as this would be their fifth in a row. I also realize that Destiny did play 1 week in the LCS, however, as this was left at a single week, I will not be including him in my rankings. Aphromoo was first place until the last week, and Huhi could have remained at that spot had he maintained better than he did. His laning had seemed to progress from what it was, and even when the rest of the team was beginning to crumble, it was the bot lane continuing to pump out massive performances. However, the playoffs of LCS Spring 2021 fixed the situation in terms of viewer count, while still failing to overtake the 2020 Summer season. It’s time for the finals to decide who will represent North America against the strongest teams in the world at MSI.
