Alucard (Post-Schrodinger) (Hellsing) I’m referencing Alucard’s quantum manipulation abilities to Captain Atom and Silver Surfer in which they all have those powers. He is the most powerful warrior of the Hellsing Organization which works against vampires and other such supernatural forces. We just didn't see enough of him to say for certain. Walter then urged his master to flee, and attacke… We all know how that turned out. Always wished these two would've had a real fight...alas. If you love to imagine the planet-exploding battles of the fictional gods who will never be, taking pointless knowledge gathered from a life spent reading and gaming and swinging it like a gladiator's sword in discussions on reddit... then welcome home, my friend. There's no reason why Luke would win against Zorin. I use "no-selling" in the context of "he took it with minimal damage" nowadays. The only reason I put Anderson there is because I thought that the Dandy Man gave Alucard a better fight than Anderson did, but in the end, it's true - Anderson was a beast, and he was capable of fighting Alucard even in the end. With no way to reach Captain's heart, Alucard's offensive arsenal is pretty much shit. vs So what if The Captain tag teamed with Walter to take down Alucard instead of fighting Seras Victoria (Rules) Walter is bloodlusted, The Captain is bloodlusted so he wont be holding back like he did with Seras, Alucard also bloodlusted They start 15 feet apart Win by death Location Hellsing The Dawn - Walter VS The Captain VOSTFR HD - YouTube.

Where this guy could resist Sera's attack I dont see him doing that against Alucard, he's alot more powerful than Sera  Sera is a full vampire here, but we all know age matters. So I brought up the fact that this was a dying man who couldn't do it. @picallo3798:   Captain holds back and uses his main powers, the giant wolf form and intangible mist form, very briefly and still whoops Seras's ass, who at the time was a true vampire like Alucard and easily stomped entire legions of Nazi vampires and one of the top vampires of the Millenium, Zorin Blitz, who had the power of illusion. Just as Alucard is Hellsing's trump card, and Alexander Anderson is Iscariot's, the Captain can be considered Millennium's.

Alucard… He is a combination of Count Dracula and Vlad the Implaler. In this thread I am talking about a non holding back Captain hell bent on annihilating Alucard. I don't think Alucard would choose a human who's weaker than someone who he made squeal like a pig as a worthy opponent to kill him. The captain is the true werewolf. But do you agree that Zorin's hax would work on Luke? He thought Luke was much stronger than he thought he was, and released Level 1 only because he thought Luke had a lot more to show. So Walter's skill progression would be: Young Walter I'd put above Luke Valentine. Follow/Fav Hellsing vs Twilight.  He didn't tank the Jackal. I know. Aizen, which I respect does not have quantum manipulation unlike Alucard in Post Schrodinger form, which results him being toasted if he either goes against Alucard, Silver Surfer, or Captain Atom. Just as Alucard is Hellsing's Trump card, and Alexander Anderson is Iscariot's, he could be considered Millenium's.

The Captain would have no way of putting him down either.. @sithlantern93:  Well sure but then he cant attack in that form either.

The implication that I got from his fight is that Alucard wanted to further humiliate Luke, not that he needed to go to level 1. I don't see Luke above Zorin, but he's possibly above old Walter. He'll solidify for a split second to smack Alucard's head off and then go back into mist form while he looks for a chance to do it again. Zorin on the other hand, did not display any impressive speed at all. I think Walter in his prime is comparable to how he was in OVA 9, but slightly weaker. He acknowledged that Anderson could overcome Alucard's powers jusr like Hellsing did 100 years ago, therefore, I believe Anderson has a chance at Alucard, especially with The Captain backing him up and the fact Alucard doesn't have his guns. Anime horrors Alucard from Hellsing and Griffith from Berserk exist as polar opposites. © 2021 GAMESPOT, A RED VENTURES COMPANY.
