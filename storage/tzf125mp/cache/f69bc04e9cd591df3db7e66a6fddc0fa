The velocity will change along the course of any river, and is determined by factors such as the gradient ( how steeply the river is losing height), the volume of water, the shape of the river channel and the amount of friction created by the bed, rocks and plants. Floodplains can be defined topographically as relatively flat surfaces that stand adjacent to river channels and occupy much of the area constituting valley bottoms. In the lower course, the river has a high volume and a large discharge. The first type of abrasion is caused by ice or glaciation. Take a look at this fantastic Rivers Lesson Plan next.

The intensity of lateral and vertical erosion is dictated by the stage in the river’s course, discussed in more detail here but essentially, in the upper stage of the river’s course (close to the source of the river) there is little horizontal erosion and lots of vertical erosion. Hard engineering management involves using artificial structures, such as dams and embankments. What are synonyms for RIVER CHANNEL? Meandering river channels are asymmetrical.
