Finck and available at Christogenea.org. 2 Peter chapter 2 KJV (King James Version) 1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.. 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. Letters of Peter, also called Epistles of St. Peter the Apostle, abbreviation Peter, two New Testament writings attributed to St. Peter the Apostle but perhaps written during the early 2nd century.  Second Peter is the apostle Peter’s last reminder to the church. Since Peter was martyred during the reign of Nero, his death must have occurred prior to a.d. 68; so it is very likely that he wrote 2 Peter between 65 and 68. Second Peter is the swan song of Peter, just as 2 Timothy is the swan song of Paul. The Second Epistle Of Peter 3 The Second Epistle Of Peter Introduction AUTHOR The apostle Peter, as stated in the salutation (1:1). Unlike 1 Peter, this letter has very weak external testimony, The Letters of Peter, together with the Letter of James, the three Letters of John, and the Letter of Jude, are part of the seven so-called Catholic Letters. Mt 17:1-9). Tradition holds that he was crucified around 64–65 A.D., which means he would have written this letter about this time. The letter therefore existed very early and was considered very authoritative. Peter opens his second letter with a greeting to believers (in Asia Minor—see introduction) (1:1-2). There are striking similarities between the two books. 1:13–14). 1:12-15 ), after he had written a prior letter ( 3:1) to the same readers (probably 1 Peter). Peter’s second epistle was written about A.D. 66, shortly after his first epistle (see 2 Pet. The writer claims to have had special revelation from the Lord concerning his demise (1:14; cf. Jn 21:18-19), and to have been present when the Lord was transfigured on the mountain (1:16-18; cf. Peter’s theme in his second letter is a simple one: pursue spiritual maturity through the Word of God as a remedy for false teaching and a right response to heretics in light of Christ’s promised second coming (2 Peter 1:3, 16). Second Peter is the third of the General Epistles (or Catholic Letters), the writings of apostles to the church at large. (b) Tradition is also unanimous for St. Peter’s author-ship. See Christogenea.com for details on obtaining the print edition. The Second Epistle of St. Peter, admitted to be very ancient even by those who question its authenticity, alludes to an earlier Epistle written by the Apostle (iii, 1). 3:1) and a short while before his martyrdom (see 2 Pet. He then begins the body of his letter in a way similar to his first epistle, and equally similar to many of Paul’s letters. He begins with positive statements about what God has done, then discusses what believers should do. “Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ.” To distinguish this epistle from the first by Peter it was given the Greek title Petrou B, “Second of Peter.” THE AUTHOR OF 2 PETER No other book in the New Testament poses as many problems of authenticity as does 2 Peter. Clearly, the same deluded false teachers who plagued God’s people in both the Old and New Testaments are still with us, making Peter’s second epistle as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago. 3 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,  Letter with a greeting to believers ( in Asia Minor—see introduction ) ( 1:1-2 ) letter therefore existed early!
