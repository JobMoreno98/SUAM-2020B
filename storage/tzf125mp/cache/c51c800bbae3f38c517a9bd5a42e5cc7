OK, close 0. AN AMERICAN BRAT gets off to a fast and funny start. She explores abuse against women, justified by a patriarchal society, making the woman a double victim. An American Brat is a novel in which America is portrayed in a fresh light. She explores abuse against women, justified by a patriarchal society, making the woman a double victim. Feroza comes to the US on a travel visa, and ends up staying for college and grad school? The book was just a series of events that led to nothing. She has only wowed her foreign readers through the culture she writes about, not the story, and she didn't create the culture. Hoping that a few months with her uncle, an MIT grad student, will soften the girl’s rigid thinking, they get more than they bargained for: Feroza, enthralled by American culture and her new freedom, insists on staying. Off to the next Sidhwa. A must read for anyone who has lived in any of those places as a student or young professional. The mother interferes with her daughter’s love life and wins - no surprise there.

This book might work for some advanced high school ELL students though they might find some of the details (particularly the political ones) to be out of date.
