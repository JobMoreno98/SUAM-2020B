Seals and sea lions share a common suite of behaviours that they use to propel themselves through the water. Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) – By David Hocking, Curator of Vertebrate Zoology and Palaeontology, Monash University Few fish can outswim a seal. This multi-angled study, published today in Current Biology, allowed us to determine how, and how effectively, seals use their … 02:17. Native Range: The South Pacific and Indian Oceans (i.e., the Indo-Pacific region). The small population size increases the species' risk of catastrophic disease impact, as seen in the New Zealand sea lion where neonatal septicaemia and meningitis contributed to 58 percent of pup deaths between 2006 and 2010. To find out, we partnered with a team of engineers to combine cutting-edge computer simulations with anatomical and live animal observations. Ruapehu District councillor leaves meeting in protest over opening karakia. This may look like your average piece of seaweed but, believe it or not, it’s actually a fish!Found along the southern and western coast of Australia, the leafy sea dragon is a member of the same family as the seahorse – the Syngnathidae family.They grow to around … With over 1000 movies available on Disney+ in Australia and New Zealand, I've put together a list of the top 100 movies available on Disney+, which includes a selection of different content available, mixing together Disney+ Originals, classic movies, new additions and much more Here is the "What's On Disney Plus" Top 100 movies on […] Endangered species include the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki), Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis); Caspian Seal (Pusa caspica), Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), and Hawaiian monk seal (M. schauinslandi). Leopard seals are the penguins’ main threat, but sea lions and orca whales are also predators. DoC sends trappers every year to control predators, and has set up a predator-proof fence around breeding grounds for when the birds return from the sea to nest. The range of the lionfish covers a very large area from western Australia and Malaysia east to French Polynesia and the United Kingdom's Pitcairn Islands, north to southern Japan and southern Korea and south to Lord Howe Island off the east coast of Australia and the Kermadec Islands of New Zealand. New Zealand sea lion. Archaeological evidence points to the fact that native sea lions were once found along the entire length of New Zealand’s coast, from the North Island right down to Stewart Island and the sub-antarctic islands, too. Hookworm infection provides an existing disease pressure for the Australian sea lion. The small population size increases the species' risk of catastrophic disease impact, as seen in the New Zealand sea lion where neonatal septicaemia and meningitis contributed to …  Pollution and non-native predators are also challenges for the big lizards, and when all three problems occur at the same time, their numbers can get dangerously low.
