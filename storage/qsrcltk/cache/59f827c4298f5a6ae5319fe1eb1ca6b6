Hirano created Alucard as a strong individual who would be deux ex machina on his own, resulting in an easy defeat of most enemies. It was a bluff on Integra's part, to talk down to the other military folks in the room who weren't able to handle the vampire situation. Mainly because my laptop has broken. As a result, Kimlinger felt Alucard's character to be series' strongest part. Vlad Tepes/Dracula was a very powerful vampire, but in the end he was still just that. Alucard continues to serve Integra as her thrall, having no choice but to comply with her every whim. Alucard (Japanese: アーカード, Hepburn: Ākādo, lit. Recent threadmarks Hellsing reacts to Abridged, Episode 8(2) Drac's late(too) New Hellsing reacts to Abridged, EPISODE 8, Alucard's(kinda) Late. [46] UK Anime Network and Manga Life agreed, feeling that Alucard looks more like a villain in the OVAs rather than a hero. He is a combination of Count Dracula and Vlad the Impaler. Alexander Anderson is a highly experienced vampire hunter. Integra also confirms it. Alucard is voiced by Jouji Nakata in Japanese and Crispin Freeman in English. [34] Patrick King from AnimeFringe said that Alucard's portrayal in the first Hellsing anime made him come across as one of the best anime character he has ever seen, comparing him with the famous Spike from Cowboy Bebop calling him "the perfect mix of grace and violence, propriety and chaos. Initially, Hirano felt the manga had issues in terms of fighting because Alucard was too powerful.

Alucard served the Hellsing Family for many years as well as their governement-founded organization in fending off supernatural threats that are invading England. [43] Joji Nakata's work as Alucard was also met with similar response by Anime News Network alongside Norio Wakamoto (Anderson) for having the best deliveries in the Japanese version. Alucard has been a popular character. However, when his army is defeated and he is about to be executed, Vlad, believing he has been abandoned by God, turns his back on the divine. So what else is there to do? [29], Critical response to Alucard's character has been positive. For instance, in the Gonzo anime, when a young Integra stands up to Alucard after he tries to intimidate her in Episode 10, he proclaims "You ARE your father's daughter! New Hellsing Reacts to Abridged, Episode 5 The Vatican Arrive(s) New Hellsing reacts to Abridged, Episode 4. After wounding Richard, Alucard allows Integra to kill him, thus making her the head of the Hellsing Organization and a master worthy of Alucard's servitude. [31] On a similar note, Alucard's nature as a vampire was noted to be a new take of the usage of the archetype due to how Alucard trains Seras Victoria to the point it feels like a coming of age for Alucard's subordinate. Originally born as Vlad Dracul Tepes of Wallachia, the man who would become known as TheCrimsonFuckr spent his childhood being raped by the sultan of the Turks, groomed to become an instrument of war by his superiors. But the big thing they did was the souls thing. As for how Alucard got more souls between Dracula and the modern day? [16][17] He can tear humans apart with ease and move faster than the eye can see. Did Alucard die in Hellsing Ultimate? [21] In a poll by AnimeAnime, Alucard was voted as the second best Nakata character behind Corporal Giroro from Sgt. [47][48] Comic Book Resources found the design stylish alongside the guns Alucard wields. Now named Alucard, he, along with a young Walter C. Dornez, were sent to Warsaw, Poland to stop Millennium's vampire production program. Multiple fans wondered if Alucard would form a relationship with his student Seras Victoria but Hirano did not find it possible. As a result, Hirano introduced the character Pip Bernadotte so he could stick him with Seras during the narrative. [28] Anime News Network listed him as one of "6 Strange Faces of Dracula's Descendents" based on how different is Alucard to the novel character. 15. Why the need to serve the Hellsing family? When he releases all of them, when there's only Dracula instead of Alucard and his hundreds of thousands of familiars, suddenly he's at his most vulnerable. Critical response to the character has been positive for Alucard's dark traits such as sadism or supernatural abilities that make him stand out as excessively violent despite being the main hero. She was likely trying to play him up like some sort of genetic experiment, or something that Hellsing made, and could thus control, rather than a supremely powerful being that basically allowed itself to be controlled. Alucard may have kept at least a few souls in his body to use for regeneration after releasing level 0. Until the weight of my past is shattered by my oncoming future. We've seen normal vampires in the series. In the world of Hellsing, Integra is seen as the last line of defense against vampires, because of her commitment to… [52], "中田譲治さんお誕生日記念！一番好きなキャラは？20年版 3位「Fate/stay night」言峰綺礼、2位「HELLSING」アーカード、1位は…", "SUTORAIKUanime Exclusive: Interview with Nakata Jouji", "Interview with Hellsing's Crispin Freeman", "Society For The Promotion Of Japanese Animation Announces SPJA Industry Award Finalists At Tokyo International Anime Fair", "Revoltech Series No.114 Alucard (14 cm PVC Figure) Kaiyodo Hellsing [JAPAN]", "6 Strange Faces of Dracula's Descendents", https://web.archive.org/web/20110308043906/http://www.mania.com/hellsing-vol-01_article_82282.html, "Hellsing: 10 Reasons Why It's The Best Vampire Manga", "Animefringe Reviews: Hellsing Vol.2: Blood Brothers", "Hellsing Ultimate DVD/Blu-ray Set 2 Anime Review", "Hellsing Ultimate DVD/Blu-ray Set 3 Anime Review", "Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga – Hellsing", "REVIEW: The HELLSING DELUXE EDITION brings a savage and sexy vampire classic back from the dead", "ASK JOHN: WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HELLSING? Though she’s part of the main trio, Seras isn’t exactly Hellsing’s … Alucard is an ancient vampire and is also known as Count Dracula (the same one as the original Bram Stoker's) and Vlad The Impaler (his original/human life). [9] The manga briefly deviates the events of Bram Stoker's Dracula in regards to his defeat. [30] Anime News Network's Mike Crandol praised Alucard for being "a refreshing change from the traditional, mopey, woe-is-me vampire anti-hero", and called him "quite the cool figure". She's never lacked for confidence, and tends towards the dramatic whenever possible (SEARCH AND DESTROY, SEARCH. A vampire devoted entirely to the current head of the Hellsing family, Integra Hellsing, Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization against other vampires and evil forces, fighting with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only killing after a target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently allowing enemies more than one chance to kill him (though only seeking to be killed by a human, having grown bored of immortality and life). Seras Gets Deeper Characterization. Therefore, Dracula only had the 'traditional' Dracula strengths. In an attempt to stop the Nazi project and to protect England and The Allies current head of the Hellsing House, Sir Arthur Hellsing, is sending his best agents — Walter C. Dornez and Alucard — into German-occupied Poland where monstrous experiments are being conducted. However, Geneon Entertainment producers called Freeman and asked him if he could return to voice Alucard again. The series mentions … [18] While often seen a male human, Alucard has a tendency to take other humanoid forms (among them being a young girl, a form he took while infiltrating the Nazi group Millennium during World War II).[19][20]. We use cookies on our websites for a number of purposes, including analytics and performance, functionality and advertising. [32] Jason Thompson commented that when the manga started "Alucard looked too much like Master of Mosquiton, or another badass manga character with John Lennon glasses" and thought he seems like Vash the Stampede from Trigun, something which AnimeNation agreed with. He could have them die, instead of him. This weapon is the first custom handgun made by Hellsing, and was presumably designed by Walter. In regards to his drawing him, Hirano claims he does not particularly care about accurate depictions of weapons in his manga and draws multiple type of angles like whenever Alucard shoots a bullet. [41] THEM Anime Reviews noted that while Alucard might come across as a villain rather than a hero due to his sadistic actions, the poorly developed villains make it easier for the viewers to root for the lead. Alucard (アーカード, Ākādo) is the most powerful vampire who serves the Hellsing Organization. I really don’t care who you are, just tell me what you want. Alucard. [6] Due to the length of Hellsing Ultimate, Freeman considered his work as a "marathon" due to the amount of lines he had to record per episode based on the screentime Alucard has. Alucard, thanks to the enhancements of the Hellsing Organization, lacks those weaknesses because he can just patch himself with their strength. Presumably he got the millions of souls before his defeat,  so what did they do exactly that helped make him what he is now? Alucard's voice portrayals by Nakata and Freeman were also met with a positive response. They also enhanced other minor mystical powers, allowing him to enter homes without invitation on top of passing through walls and being strong enough to use some of his powers during the day. Alucard does NOT DIE! [1] Among the multiple changes the original video animations (OVAs) Hellsing Ultimate had in comparison to the manga was the concept of Alucard wielding his guns with his teeth, something only done in Gonzo's television series. Born in 1431, he later became known Vlad Ţepeş (\"Vlad the Impaler\") and as Kazıklı Bey (\"the Impaling Prince\") by the Turks, gaining a fearsome reputation throughout the lands. Did the modifications to Alucard cause the vampires he creates to be the same style as him? [40] The same site also praised Alucard's final fight against Anderson in Hellsing Ultimate, citing it as the greatest highlight of the entire series and found Hirano's take on the Dracula myth as one of the "wildest interpretation" he has seen. Though in the Hellsing universe, who doesn't? He serves the Hellsing Organization and is the most powerful vampire in Hellsing. Take the most well known vampire in history, bind him with multiple layers of wards and locks, supe him up with the best and most dangerous spells the British Isles can muster, and you've got yourself a bonafide Occult Superweapon. Hellsing as a whole seems to be lacking in supernatural weaponry as well, most likely because the Iscariot division snatches them all up (I.e. [45], Criics often commented on Alucard's appearance. Im guessing that when Abraham Van Hellsing first defeated him he was probably not as powerful as he is during the titular series(I might be wrong but I think the show considered the book Dracula to be canon). The manga Hellsing: The Dawn and its animated adaptation focus on a younger Alucard taking the form of a woman while working during WWII. Alucard didn't really die. Most normal people don't know the supernatural exists, let alone that Dracula is real and works for the British government. [44] Manga News critcized Alucard's fate in the finale for his apparent death during the fight against the Millennium organization only to return in the final chapter for unexplained reasons. Advanced Regeneration: Alucard's ability to regenerate is considerably greater than any other vampire's. However, he felt that there were easier episodes due to the protagonist having fewer lines as the narrative was more primarily focused on a supporting character. He is the Hellsing Organization 's trump card and he is a powerful Transcendent Vampire. [50][51] In a more negative view, Alucard's female form was crticized by Anime News Network due to Hirano not being able to draw properly a female character, resulting in the female form to look as tomboyish as Integra Hellsing. No level Zero unless stated - Both sides are in-character, have standard equipment/abilities and are at their absolute peak - Alucard wins via annihilation or surrender of the verse. What solidifies this? Alucard is violent, sadistic, and masochistic. [42] Similarly, DVD Talk praised how Ultimate portrayed Alucard in the finale not only for his fights against Anderson and Walter but also about how his past life is explored while acclaiming Freeman's work. Why does Alucard wait in the basement for Luke Valentine? Meanwhile, Alucard would keep a deep bond with his master, Integra Hellsing, early in the story but he refrained from regarding it as a romantic style. The only thing Hellsing has done to Alucard is put limiters on his power, which were presumably put in place by Abraham Van Hellsing back during the Dracula incident when he decided to cage Alucard rather than finish him. Unfortunately, there will be a lack of videos over the next few weeks. He is arguably the first vampire that ever existed.It is revealed in Alucard's flashback in Chapter 70 of Hellsing, Castlevania (2) that he was After his defeat by Abraham Van Helsing, he becomes his servant. Freeman's work for providing a "gothic depth befitting a powerful master vampire". Bram Stoker's Dracula is 100% canon, right up until the ending. For the prequel Hellsing: The Dawn, a dynammic was used between Alucard, Integra and Walter to act properly since Alucard was more active. That was an unwavering part of the unfolding story. He confirms beheading is enough to kill them. The kana used for his name is pronounced as "aka", and has the same sound as the Japanese word for "red". Alucard seems to be quite We use a [Watsonian point of view](http://fanlore.org/wiki/Watsonian_vs._Doylist), versus Doylist. Nothing is known about their relationship, although it's possible that Alucard respected him. Arucard), previously Count Dracula (ドラキュラ, Dorakyura), is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Hellsing manga and anime series created by Kouta Hirano. He has nothing left to patch himself up with, so that's why Anderson suddenly had a chance to kill him so easily. Dracula starts his career by fighting the Ottomans, believing that God does not reward prayer, but instead wants mortals to show their faith visibly. Second, during WWII, his body was going through modifications of the occult and he took the form of a little girl (aka Girlycard) and went on missions with Walter. He said that villain characters and ones with distinct personalities were easier than ones with not much personality as they can be shaped and changed up. Luke and Jan's attack on Hellsing HQ is a success only because Alucard for some reason simply decides to sit back and let it happen. Alucard is a vampire and main protagonist of the Hellsing anime and manga series. Years after his defeat, Dracula became a servant of the Van Helsing family, who not only augmented his formidable abilities, but also placed shackles on his power. [4], In an interview with Anime News Network, American voice actor Crispin Freeman stated that Alucard was the first big role he had ever since becoming an actor. Alucard is a vampire (guessed to be Dracula himself, but why get into semantics now) who is under the servitude to his human master, Sir Integral Wingates Hellsing (note: she is a woman), who he has served for at least ten years or more. It is not explicitly shown or stated how he became a vampire, but in one scene he drinks blood from the floor in front of an executioner. These modifications were most likely begun when they realized Hitlers delving into the occult as a means for victory meant they had to improve what they had. If anything, Alucard owes his allegiance to The Major. [23] Various merchandise based on Alucard's appearance has been created, including action figures,[24] bust figures[25] and key-chains. He can pass through walls, summon literally thousands of familiars. However, when his army is defeated and he is about to be executed, Vlad, believing he has been abandoned by God, turns his back on the divine. Even though the Millennium is the central evil organization, they are not strong enough to fight Alucard. Alucard's design also stood out for being called "stylish", praising his outfits and weaponry. When the OVAs, Hellsing Ultimate, were announced, Freeman was not contacted to take the part of Alucard again, something that bothered his fans. [14], Whenever he drinks his victim's blood, Alucard also sucks out the soul of that person to obtain their memories while converting the victim into an extension of himself referred to as a Familiar. In comparing the two Alucards he voiced, he believes they are nearly different individuals as a result of how the OVAs differ from the television series. [7], Alucard is a vampire working for the organization Hellsing. Decades later, Abraham's direct descendant Arthur Hellsing gives the Count the codename "Alucard". As a result, he thinks Alucard's battle against Anderson had a better show of battle in comparison to the previous battle against Anderson were both fighters were nearly equals. Looks like you're using new Reddit on an old browser. But like a lot of superweapons, his development for delayed, wars ended, and with millennium apparently dissolved what need would there be for a tool such as he? Shortly after Arthur Hellsing's death in 1989, Alucard was awakened and resuscitated by Integra's blood. A little thing called World War II happened. [1], After manga volume 8, during series' climax, the author felt he "got a little hasty" and ended the long battle between Alucard and Anderson. Alucard is far more powerful than any standard vampire, but even stronger then his original form as Vlad Tepes/Dracula. He is the most powerful warrior of the Hellsing Organization which works against vampires and other such supernatural forces. [36], In regards to his role in the story, Comic Book Resources felt Alucard's battle to be enjoyable due to the amount of gore provided through his fighting style involving both supernatural abilities and usage of guns. The ending is just not consistent with the underlying philosophy of the story. Alucard is pre-schrodinger - Alucard appears within Kamino ward in the morning. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast, More posts from the AskScienceFiction community. In regards to Walter's betrayal, Hirano decided to use him as avillain by the time Alucard, who had been sleeping underground, revived, to face Integra and claimed taht despite the close experience both character has, Walter was still clearly weaker than Alucard. Vlad Tepes, better known as Alucard, Dracula, The Crimson Fucker and various other aliases, is the main protagonist of the Hellsing Ultimate Abridged series by Team Four Star. Alucard also appears in the prequel series Hellsing: The Dawn, taking a female form alongside his partner Walter C. Dornez to end World War II in a fight against Nazis. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Alucard was nominated as one of the best male characters with Jouji Nakata's portrayal of the character also being nominated. Every time he took a hit that could kill him, he used his 'familiars' to help repair himself, something normal vampires couldn't do.
