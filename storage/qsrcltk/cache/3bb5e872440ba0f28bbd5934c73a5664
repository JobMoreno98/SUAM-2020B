Wallachia: Reign of Dracula Review: Castlevania Mania (Nintendo Switch) Wallachia: Reign of Dracula combines a 16-bit Castlevania aesthetic with the run-and-gun gameplay of Contra. Thankfully, the Game Boy sequel Castlevania II: Belmont’s Revenge is a different kettle of fish entirely and ranks as one of the best action titles on the Game Boy – it also has an utterly amazing soundtrack. Lazy collection. https://www.ign.com/.../05/24/castlevania-anniversary-collection-review It won't be too noticeable but still noticeable. I don't know if it's a glitch, or what not, but I tried character swapping with the - button, and it wouldn't work (I had Sylva as my secondary). And now the wait for the Contra Collection begins. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a Castlevania game in every aspect except name, and will satisfy anyone looking to revisit Symphony of the Night and other Metroidvania-era games. @GrailUK It's ok, but the movement is very sluggish. A remake of Simons Quest with hand drawn art and proper translation would be amazing. Metacritic Game Reviews, Wallachia: Reign of Dracula for Switch, Fast-paced! A pleasant surprise follows in the shape of Castlevania: Bloodlines, known in Europe as Castlevania: The New Generation. The omission of discussed titles begs a Volume 2 to exist. I think it was not knowing its purpose or areas it should be tried. Honestly, the absence of The Adventure Rebirth is baffling. The "Color" filter reminds me more of the SGB than the GBC. Castlevania: Bloodlines, on the other hand, hasn’t seen a re-release since its exclusive debut on the SEGA Mega Drive system back in 1994. Hosted by 44 Bytes. That really was a great addition, the Belmonts’ aversion to stairs was always a bit silly. Nice collection. I did go back and beat it on my NES a few years ago with the help of a guide which I really didn't need up until the end. Still, even with the questionable inclusion of Simon's Quest and Castlevania: The Adventure, the 'highs' on offer are among the highest points in the entire franchise, and a Western debut for Kid Dracula is a lovely treat for retro gamers looking for something new. The Bloodlines mapping mirrors this as well despite being made for the Sega's A/B/C control scheme. I’ll definitely replay Castlevania 3 once they update it and put the Japanese version. Updated: 19 Jul 2017 5:42 pm. Like Zelda II, it was an ambitious concept with unique ideas that needed a bit more polish. Since I already played CV I-IV, the other four games are what I'm here for. @konbinilife The button assignment is A/Y for Jump and B/X for whip for the NES games. So the review questions the inclusion of Simon's Quest and the first GB game?  Screen filters aside, there are no real other options to choose from. Sure its alright, but its just not quite the same. (Can't wait!). I wasn't aware of this existing, or at least thoroughly forgot. This collection has issues. kinda like resident evil (except the new remake of 2). After that I'll be jumping into Simon's Quest which is the game I played the most growing up. I am going to wait, and hope they add button mapping. 30 Jahre und nur ein bisschen müde It’s a smart move and one that ensures the emulation is as accurate as it possibly could be. Just hoping we get that 2nd collection and release all the other castlevania games, @techdude Hoping the 2nd collection is a done deal, seeing as Konami's announcements used the wording "...the FIRST Castlevania Anniversary Collection...". The collection of games itself is great I think and emulation seems on point. It should be noted that the Game Boy games are at least treated to their own special display filters: standard black-and-white (in both 4:3 and pixel perfect), a ‘dot matrix’ effect (which emulates the gloriously sickly green-and-yellow Game Boy screen, complete with a very faint grid), and a ‘color’ filter which makes everything a strange brown in that lovely way a Game Boy Color used to half-heartedly attempt to add colour to non-GBC games. Those who like their games to fill their screen will be disappointed: unless you choose 4:3 with scanlines or the god-awful super-stretchy 16:9 filter, every other option puts the game in a window in the middle of the screen, leaving noticeable borders at the top and bottom. So this has the same poor button configuration and plain black borders as the NES online service, well done. From what I’ve completed so far, rankings are: 1. @LunarFlame17 Totally agree. If its Symphony of the night, gotta be the original limited edition, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdNyaBBBX4. It doesn't make it less of a stupid oversight. I didn't even mind grinding too much, though there were times when I wanted that to go a little faster. It’s great to have it on here too: it’s a hugely underrated Castlevania with a slightly darker and gorier tone to the Nintendo titles. While a disappointing bundle as a whole, it's impossible to hate the games included in this collection. Konami's Castlevania Anniversary Collection traces the origins of the historic vampire franchise. I hear it so far in Castlevania, a persistent random beeping noise. Then, daring to dream, we wondered if Konami would actually go far enough to include the legendary PlayStation game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Finally, rounding things off is an interesting little game that many will dismiss as a ludicrous decision but is actually a fairly big deal for the wider Castlevania series. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End – breite Spielerbasis für den Naughty-Dog-Titel, Resident Evil Village – erste Verkaufszahlen überzeugen, The Division – wird immer noch fleißig gespielt, Resident Evil 3 – Capcom nennt aktuelle Verkaufszahlen, PlayStation VR – frische Gerüchte um technische Details des PS5-Modells, PlayStation 5 – zwei neue DualSense-Farben in Kürze zu kaufen, DariusBurst Another Chronicle EX+ – Shooterkost für PS4 & Switch vorgestellt, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition – Community Tribute Video zum Launch, Mehr Infos über die Nutzung von Cookies und unseren Datenschutz. Sadly, if you were expecting this you’re out of luck: the collection hits a chronological dead end at the Mega Drive game and then goes backwards, which is both good and bad. Castlevania 2 was worth a playthrough mainly because of the creepy atmosphere and awesome music. Perhaps they'll come later. I never could get into the timed 'stages' versions. Super Castlevania IV (Super NES) Its awesome, the best in my opinion, getting this game tommorow. In the minority I'm sure but I'm glad they included the game boy games and kid Dracula. Willkommen! I am waiting on the Contra series though and I hope they add some other decent games and not just ebook. With Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night on the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Swich, director Koji Igarashi returns to his Castlevania routes with an excellent gothic horror adventure. Rondo of Blood / Dracula X (1993/95, TCD/SNES) Despite the sheer volume of solid gold hits in the series, Castlevania Anniversary Collection is a somewhat mixed bag from Konami, with stone-cold classics sharing the spotlight with a couple of undead clunkers that really should have remained dead and buried. With Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night on the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Swich, director Koji Igarashi returns to his Castlevania routes with an excellent gothic horror adventure. I bought it and so far I have enjoyed it. Great you can adjust - I have to use A/X and trick my brain - but it's definitely not a scheme for players from 'back in the day'. We're not always going to like the same things. Für die Umsetzungen ist ­dieses Mal Top-Restaurator M2 verantwortlich, allerdings sind die ­Optionen wieder etwas eingeschränkt: Nur ein Save pro Spiel ist mager und bei Format, Filtern und Scanlines wäre mehr … I also agree, there is zero reason for them not to include button remapping. It's great but I wish we would get a part 2 later on then package them in physical. If playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device. Let's start off with the bad. It’s a great addition and one that fans of the series will appreciate. If the default were like you suggested, any game that tells you to "press B" would need you to actually press Y, while doing what the game suggests would actually be a press of the A button. I'm so confused by people who are complaining about the pre-Symphony Castlevania titles, and how they'll hold off for Volume 2 in one breath, and then say that they were really hoping for Adventure Rebirth in the next! @LunarFlame17 Try playing it without the guide first. even with the questionable inclusion of Simon's Quest ". @Ralizah Button mapping, physical games, and game manuals are all rare oddity nowadays. Simon's Quest was one of my favourite NES games, it had 'think out of the box' styled puzzles with enough replayability to at least try for the best ending. Also, the version of Castlevania that was included crashes if too many sprites are on-screen, meaning its rough times when you get to Death. @LunarFlame17 Thank you. Here are mini-reviews for each of the Castlevania Anniversary Collection games: Castlevania . I feel that even though castlevania the adventure was slow, it wasn't that bad to me. It gives the player the option to use any combination that feels natural to them, A&X or Y&X or B&A or B&Y. Played it everywhere. The "you now prossess Dracula's rib" typos and such are a bummer but not serious. Beste Anniversary Collection der Konami Titel. a mixed bag, missing classics, so on the scale from 8 to 10 I will give it an 8. Not so much with this one. But CV4 was one of the biggest disappointments for me. These are the games I would expect to see in a Castlevania collection of 8 titles, to be honest. You can see them in the screenshots above. Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Konami. Kid Dracula was okay, more of a Mega Man knock-off than a kid-friendly Castlevania when it comes to its gameplay. März über 3,9 Millionen Einheiten des Action-Adventures verkauft. Happily, it’s an improvement over the last offering, but there are still some areas where it could be better. The Adventure ReBirth (2009, Wii) @Mugen80 Oh, trust me, I have. Note that the Switch version is currently experiencing major performance issues and 505 Games has issued a statement that it is shifting ... Castlevania: Symphony of … it was my first Gameboy castlevania that I played, and able to bring on the go. It's kinda bizarre that the collection didn't include the japanese versions of the games by default (For Castlevania 3 in particular that is almost undeniably the superior version) but since they've already promised to update those in then that should be fine. Seite 1 Auch Castlevania bekommt eine Sammlung – und zwar von den linearen, actionlastigen Ursprüngen, die späteren Metroidvania-Episoden bleiben außen vor. IV remains a classic, Bloodlines is a solid game that was fun to play for the first time. What kind of weird anniversary collection would it have been without them? Castlevania Anniversary Collection is an excellent, high quality retro collection. Vs.  I’m wondering how do most play hand held? Now it’s time for the second helping, this time aimed at the Castlevania series: specifically, most of its 8-bit and 16-bit entries. NO!.........NO! So I was going to pass on Simon's quest due what I've always heard about it.  	Mahjong... https://youtu.be/4K7_foqAZ-A Castlevania Anniversary Collection has 8 Classic (well, almost) games from the well loved series. Were it not for missing Haunted Castle, which sucks but is relevant and already on their Arcade release, this would be the perfect Volume 1 of CV history, As a huge CV fan I got the collection but I want it patched so I could remap the controls as I see fit. @Spiders I'm sure the rationale is to avoid being confusing as all heck. There's no 4:3 screen filling option without scanlines, as you say. @MJ1200 Bad button mapping? Having maps definitely sounds helpful. Played Symphony of the Night for first time few weeks ago and, after persevering, ended up really enjoying it. That BITES. Kid Dracula (or Akumajō Special: Boku Dracula-kun, to give it its proper Japanese title) was only ever released on the Famicom in Japan, and while the West would later get a Game Boy remake, the original was never released over here. Cryptic clues that make game almost unplayable without a guide, awkward transition between day/night segments, manshions without a major boss, throwing holy water everywhere to uncover trap doors, a way too easy final battle with Dracula, but I still enjoy with these warts. Castlevania Collection for Switch REVIEW - ALMOST Perfect! @LunarFlame17 Simon's Quest is my favorite out of the original trilogy. I liked the castlevania games on the list. You may sneer at its inclusion over other titles, but try it first: you may be surprised. Glad to see collections like this popping up. See, Castlevania’s writer Warren Ellis had major sexual misconduct accusations come out against him just under a year ago. Demnach wurden bis zum 31. Played it again last week and it seems even worse than before. It really is a good game with terrible English translation. Anyway, the problems this review mentions are roughly the same as in Arcade Collection, but the score is significantly higher. Leaving Bloodlines for last as it'll probably be the best one of the bunch. https://www.nintendo-insider.com/castlevania-anniversary-collection-review so these are just straight up ports, they didn't fix any of II's translations or anything? " Also woth noting Castlevania never gives you a named button prompt in-game. The eight games here cover (with one exception) the early Castlevania games on Nintendo systems. It's obviously a terrible default assignment - Super Castlevania IV, which had the same 4 button layout, is B Jump, Y Whip (R Item). Deiland: Pocket Planet Edition - Princely Patience Is Required, Famicom Detective Club: The Girl Who Stands Behind - This Is The Spooky One, Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir - A Delightful And Silly Mystery, Subnautica: Below Zero - A Rather Cool Sequel, Subnautica - A Wondrous Trip Under The Sea, Castlevania Anniversary Collection Review, though that’s on the way, according to Konami, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy5oZXHTF2w. Ein Patch hat inzwischen wie angekündigt die japanischen Versionen integriert – eine wichtige Ergänzung, wurde für den Westen doch stark an Spielbalance und Schwierigkeit geschraubt. If they ever make a 2nd collection, it should include, Castlevania: Rondo of BloodCastlevania: Symphony of the NightCastlevania: LegendsCastlevania: Circle of the MoonCastlevania: Harmony of DissonanceCastlevania: Aria of SorrowCastlevania: The Adventure ReBirthKid Dracula (Game Boy). Reviews Castlevania Requiem Review: A Nostalgic Disappointment. @Spiders On the NES, B was whip and A was jump and most games were like that: b action, a jump. It's questionable to include Castlevania II in a Castlevania collection? I hope more companies follow suit. I know guides can be helpful in a lot of situations but in this games case its a requirement. Darin bekommen wir das Level "Motoko's Thunderdome" vorgestellt, in dem... Xbox One / Xbox Series X & S: I actually love Simon's Quest regardless of the issues it has here and there. The potential next collection is what I'm really looking forward! Der bunte und kurzweilige Third-Person-Shooter kann somit, wie geplant, pünktlich am... tte Seite 1 The Division... Capcom hat aktuelle Absatzzahlen von Resident Evil 3 verkündet. I loved it at the time, and completed it. Before any real discussion of Castlevania Season 4 gets underway, we must take a detour. As in the arcade collection there’s also a bonus digital book that breaks down each game, includes interviews with the developers and the like. It also appears that the version of Castlevania (NES) used in the English language version of the game is the original PRG0 release which occasionally crashes after you beat Death in the 15th stage: Konami will probably need to patch this and swap it out for the PRG1 version, though if the patch with Japanese versions does eventually turn up that’ll be a workaround (the Japanese game doesn’t have that bug). Aria of Sorrow (2003, GBA) Yep, I can't wait for further releases with Symphony of the night, rondo of blood, Dracula X, the third Gameboy game, Castlevania 64(hopefully with 60 fps graphics improvement), Rebirth WiiWare game, and all the GBA and DS games! Die Macher bezeichnen Ihr Erstlingswerk als ”rekursive Ego-Knobelei” – was hat es damit auf sich? we will see in future games, what will happen. Talk about a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, the Switch version of Bloodstained appears to be the weakest so far. CTRL + SPACE for auto-complete. Both versions of that game. Review Deiland: Pocket Planet Edition - Princely Patience Is Required, Review Famicom Detective Club: The Girl Who Stands Behind - This Is The Spooky One, Review Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir - A Delightful And Silly Mystery, Mini Review Subnautica: Below Zero - A Rather Cool Sequel, Mini Review Subnautica - A Wondrous Trip Under The Sea. But I'm right there with you on game preservation. These collections are always so fun to look at because you are getting such a wide range of fun experiences. Although the presence of Bloodlines and Kid Dracula makes it worth a purchase if you're a fan of this series. Abgesehen vom ersten Game-Boy-Ableger und dem NES-Sequel Simon’s Quest sind die Titel hervorragend gealtert: Das erste und ­dritte 8-Bit-Spiel liefern bis heute ­harte, aber faire Lehrstücke in Sachen Design. M2 nailed it once again!It's a 9 for me due to the ridiculous Game Boy first game. A pet peeve of mine with the Switch is tiny text, and this continues here in the menus. The games themselves are fun, though. Next up is Castlevania: The Adventure, the first Game Boy outing for the series which serves no real purpose here other than to remind us that it exists; it's a technical disaster, clunking and stuttering all over the place and running at about half a mile an hour (and yes, that’s how it played back in the day too – it was one of the very first games for Nintendo's monochrome marvel). Kid Dracula is an excellent inclusion. Doesn't really matter if they are technical disasters/boring or not. Spot on review. @nessisonett That's a common reason and I get it. The frames are nice though, so the default is usually fine. I remember as a kid returning the cartridge for repair, as I figured it must have contained an error. Castlevania: The Adventure Rebirth (Wii Ware) @Torakaka Don’t forget to put Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood in there! It's playable, but it's not comfortable, and it's not like every other platformer on the system isn't mapping action/jump to Y/B as standard or an option, save the exceptions that prove the rule like Odallus, Oniken, and Gonner. @imgrowinglegs I was only joking about the borders but having grown up playing the SNES a lot B was always jump with Y being whip/run/attack depending upon the game so it always feels awkward to me.  	Quantum Replica - 9,99 Euro It's still a good game though. Now I know that is a pretty big caveat, but this review makes it sound as if Simon’s Quest is a big ol’ heaping dumpster fire, and it’s not. Fun game and a total Castlevania parody. What guides are you guys/gals using that you would recommend? Vote with your wallet for those who wants a volume 2 of these Castlevania classics. I do miss the omission of Legends and Dracula X, and am eager for the first patch that adds the Japanese versions in, because they're generally all superior. All amazing games! Been playing this over the weekend. III was more challenging than I remember and the original has ages somewhat with its sticky controls. I can't wait to play through it again. The reviewer shouldn’t be obligated to agree with the consensus. Konami recently kicked off its trio of Anniversary Collection compilations with an assortment of arcade shooters that, while certainly classics, were let down by limited emulation options (though since then Konami has confirmed it’ll be fixing most of our concerns with a patch). I'm pretty sure the Castlevania collection on PS4 has X has jump and Square as attack and what about the 16 bit games on this? Would had easily been a 10/10 for me if Konami had only include these: Castlevania (NES) That one is bad. Metacritic Game Reviews, Arcade Archives: Vs. Castlevania for Switch, If you think it's scary on the outside, wait'll you see the basement! Adding PS and DS titles probably would be too much. Yes please! Great music and it always felt great upgrading your whip. Castlevania 3 is great as always and I love Bloodlines graphics and bosses. The B/A action/jump is a standard of all platformers on the NES, and the proper translation to the 4-button layout is to move those actions to Y/B. But I see alot of people saying it's actually really fun, with a guide of course. Many will rightly wonder why Dracula X and Symphony of the Night are missing, and if we were allowed to dream for a minute we’d have loved to see the aforementioned WiiWare title Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth on here. Its a wider palying field not a stretched one.  	Karma. It’s mechanically sound, the music and graphics are great... As long as you have some help with the absurdly obtuse puzzles, there’s no reason you shouldn’t have fun with it. The only issue is it can leave you a bit directionless, and I was stuck on one point of the game for ages until I read I had to kneel with a red crystal at a certain place to summon a tornado. The same can’t be said for Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest, the NES sequel notorious for its decision to switch things to a more open-world RPG style similar to Zelda II. @JJAwiiu I don't think it's less confusing than fighting 29 years of muscle memory using a 4 face button controller. I really appreciate how Konami threw in some of the lesser appreciated titles rather than just slapping the most popular games on there and calling it a day. Netflix’s Castlevania Review. Simon's Quest was a first step along those lines, poorly translated though it might have been. As I said, we're not all going to like the same games, even well-regarded ones. Castlevania 5. Castlevania - Konami zieht neuen Ableger für Nintendo Switch in Betracht Konami Europa denkt anscheinend über ein Castlevania für die Nintendo Switch nach, nicht zuletzt dank der Netflix-Serie. Very excited to finally get this collection. Gaming since the mid-'80s. then again i'm no castlevania fan. Now all we need is Collection 2 for the Game Boy Advance and DS titles. I feel like this list would be incredible!!! I actually like the 16:9 filter for the 16bit games. Jump with A or Y, whip with B or X. Is this collection perfect? @LinktotheFuture darn right.for me it would be nice to see button mapping be standard for any new games, especially on switch with its choice of controllers and whatnot (esp if you want to use the gamecube controller). By Jesse Schedeen. "Please Konami, Stop Trolling Us And Release Castlevania: SotN On Switch Already" Oh, if you trully want play in this game that much, just stop squeaking and play it … E: Also did the reviewer just call Belmont's Revenge rubbish? GBA versions, while similar style, would have been nice, even for a higher price. Are you a Vampire, if so you need to get a LIFE - what with being a undead - zing. Will get to the other games in the Collection soon. Maybe Dracula X being missing means it will accompany the rest of the Dracula X games on the second collection. It's awkward. I really enjoyed Rebirth on Wii. @Torakaka other than SotN the gba and DS games are the best! That part in the aqueduct with fishman and those birds drove me up the wall. Digitalverkäufe sind hier berücksichtigt. Hopefully the inclusion of NES Kid Dracula outside of Japan for the first time bodes well for Konami including some PARODIUS games in any future arcade cimpilation. Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol are back! And the two of them are already in a separate package called "Castlevania: Requiem". If not for the bad translation it would be tied with Suoer Castlevania for my favorite classic. Castlevania The Adventure was absolutely awful but I'm glad I finally played it.  	Rabisco+ - 4,99 Euro @konbinilife I find it sad there is no button re-mapping because besides that, the collection is awesome. Perhaps that would work better with smaller sprites. And when I saw that it was coming to the Nintendo Switch, I just remembered the days of playing Castlevania on-the-go. The "bad translation" bit is a myth. As for where they cut off the games included, the inclusion of all games prior to Rondo of Blood (except the forgettable arcade game, which is in the arcade collection) makes sense. Castlevania Requiem Review: A Nostalgic Disappointment Reviews While a disappointing bundle as a whole, it's impossible to hate the games included in this collection. Die SNES-Episode strotzt nur so vor spielerischen, grafischen und akustischen Ideen und die Mega-Drive-Episode ist vielleicht die Kulmination des klassischen Castlevania-Prinzips: Bloodlines vermischt durchdachtes Level­design mit technischer Finesse. @subpopz Plus, the games average out to $2.50 apiece, so who cares if a couple of them are subpar? @MJ1200 then move your thumb up and use A-jump and X-whip. @Mgalens Good point! I think it's just a comprehensive collection of the first years, and the only complaint I have about it is... where is Vampire Killer, the noticeably different Castlevania for MSX? Already completed Castlevania 4, Kid Dracula, Bloodlines and Castlevania the Adventure. Included is a unique eBook with details provided by developers, artists and … Castlevania Review Although Castlevania for mobile is a poor value, fans of the series will certainly get something out of it. Incredible games all of them. I know a lot of people have warm memories of it (hence the fact it was picked for the ReBirth series), but I think that might be because the system was new and they were more forgiving, perhaps? Naturally, the original NES version of Castlevania is the first on the list, and it still holds up brilliantly well 33 years after its initial release. @Galenmereth Oops, not sure how that got through proofing. Hopefully there's another collection in the future with Rondo of Blood, SotN, and some of the GBA games. @sdelfin I forgot about jumping on stairs in Rondo! This isn’t the only surprise in the package. Demnach kommt man auf über drei Millionen weltweit ausgelieferte Einheiten.  Note: this is a mostly spoiler-free review of Castlevania Season 3, which is available to stream now on Netflix. Für die Umsetzungen ist ­dieses Mal Top-Restaurator M2 verantwortlich, allerdings sind die ­Optionen wieder etwas eingeschränkt: Nur ein Save pro Spiel ist mager und bei Format, Filtern und Scanlines wäre mehr Flexibilität schön gewesen. EDIT: Odallus' latest update set the default mapping to B jump, Y attack. The only possible rationale is the tight spacing between Y/B and the right stick on the Joy Con, but still that should be the default option, not some backwards Soviet button mapping. @stephenmunn That chirping noise is my single complaint with this collection. I'll still be buying this as all the NES games are brilliant as is the Megadrive game with Castlevania IV still the best in the series for me. By Avery Score on July 9, 2004 at 5:17PM PDT Konami's own game on this collection figured out the proper mapping for a 4-button layout decades ago. I thought Castlevania: The Adventure was decent in the 90s. However I would like to see some GBA/Gamecube era titles getting collections/ports/re-releases too. Wenn Sie die Website weiter nutzen, stimmen Sie der Verwendung von Cookies zu. Only a couple of Castlevania II's clues were translated poorly (such as the famous tornado hint). Insomniac Games gibt bekannt, dass Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart Goldstatus erreicht hat. Button mapping should be standard on every retro collection. Castlevania: Bloodlines (Sega Genesis) Is he feeling pumped up or burned out? There's no difference for me.  	Mass Effect Legendary Edition - 69,99 Euro They did the same thing with tetris99 and it threw me off for a bit, but then I realized it's perfect because it accommodates both thumb orientations (b,y and b,a) whichever one might prefer.You just move your thumb to a, x and it's what you want. CV4 was definitely experimental. I had to buy it. @Spiders I should have made it clearer that I was addressing your complaint specifically about the NES Online button mapping defaults being the way they were. That way we don't had to suffer through the slow pace Game Boy ports, the complicated Simon's Quest, and save the Metroidvania games for another compilation. I'm excited to get a chance to play Kid Dracula. @retro_player_22 Whilst some input delay is inherent for any emulator, it's usually something so small that it's unnoticeable to most people.  	Subnautica: Below Zero - 29,99 Euro A platform game inspired by great video game classics (Castlevania).
