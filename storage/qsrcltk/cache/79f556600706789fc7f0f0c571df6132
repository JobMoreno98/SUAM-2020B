Now famed as the "Red Comet" for his exploits in the Battle of Loum, he receives a two-rank special promotion to lieutenant commander. Char Aznable An ace pilot of the Principality of Zeon forces. A decisive battle between Zeon and the Earth Federation begins at Side 5, or Loum. Roughly nine months later, Lieutenant Commander Char will order him to infiltrate Side 7 in pursuit of the Earth Federation Forces' Operation V, leading to a battle with the Gundam. Char Aznable, born Casval Rem Deikun and commonly known by the nickname "The Red Comet", is the most prominent villain from the Universal Century (UC) timeline of the Gundam anime franchise.He is best known for being the eternal arch-nemesis of the original Gundam pilot, Amuro Ray. During the Battle of Loum, he serves under the command of Lieutenant JG Char, and pilots the mobile suit MS-05 Zaku I during its first deployment in a fleet battle. Episode 6 (Dub) Rise of the Red Comet. Char Aznable (シャア・アズナブル, Chā Azunaburu), born Casval Rem Deikun (キャスバル・レム・ダイクン, Kyasubaru Remu Daikun) and also gone by the name Édouard Mass (エドワウ・マス, Edowau Masu), is a fictional character from the Gundam franchise. The iconic launch scenes of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable from Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 PS2 edited with the song "Gallant Char" from the MSG OST. The Battle of Loum is a conflict featured in the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga and its OVA adaptation. - The battle ends in victory for the Zeon forces, but Dozle Zabi's failure in attacking General Revil's fleet could've easily been avoided.  During the Battle of Loum, the Zeon 603 Technical Evaluation Division set up and deployed a massive cannon, the QCX-76A Jormungand. Famous mobile suit pilots such as Char Aznable, Ramba Ral, and the Black Tri-stars make a name for themselves in this battle. The Zeon ace Char Aznable, driven by revenge, goes into action as the "Battle of Loum" finally begins. In the Battle of Loum, he pilots an MS-06R-1A Zaku II High Mobility Type as the leader of the Black Tri-Stars, and also commands one of the two battalions of the Special Assault Regiment. For one thing, he is a formidable pilot who can rival Amuro in his White Devil. Char Aznable (Actually Deikun's son Casval.) General Revil was captured by the Black Tri-Stars, and several other Zeon aces (most notably Char Aznable, Heirshy, Shin Matsunaga, and Johnny Ridden) first made a name for themselves during the battle. Ortega A pilot in the Principality of Zeon forces. The Battle of Loum takes place just five days later, which is barely enough time for a Federation fleet to travel from Luna II to Side 5, if it started the moment the colony landed - certainly not enough time to go back to Luna II, reassemble an entire fleet, and then go all the way across the Earth Sphere to Side 5. Nothing pushes the protagonist to bring out his hidden strengths more than a good antagonist. MS-06S Char’s Zaku II Head Height: 17.5m / Overall Width: 9.2m (9.7m including spikes) Char Aznable was valued for his achievements in history’s first mobile suit battle on the lunar surface of Mare Smythii and was re-appointed as a Principality of Zeon officer and received this mobile suit once becoming a mobile suit pilot.
