He is drunk and has just had a huge row with Miss Moffatt, rebelling at the constant control and the humiliation from those who call him “the teacher’s little dog.” Bessy sings a sweet-sounding but bawdy Welsh song to him, and they fall into each other's arms. CBS Entertainment Location. The Corn Is Green is a 1979 American made-for-television drama film starring Katharine Hepburn as a schoolteacher determined to bring education to a Welsh coal mining town, despite great opposition. Then the Postmistress comes in with a telegram. Miss Moffatt goes with him. They will talk later—and Bessie is to tell no one, not even her mother. Watty suggests that Miss Moffatt adopt the child. That night, Bessie sneaks out the window to waylay Morgan as he leaves the house. It was adapted from the 1938 play of the same name by Emlyn Williams, which originally  starred Ethel Barrymore. The Corn Is Green is a 1945 American drama film  starring Bette Davis  as a schoolteacher determined to bring education to a Welsh coal mining  town despite great opposition. Miss Moffatt brings the Squire around by skillfully playing on his vanity, suggesting that if the Earl of Southampton can patronize a Shakespeare, he can support a Morgan Evans. She sets up a school to teach fundamental education to the villagers. Davis is great and this is one of John Dall's signature roles. One of her students Morgan Evans turns from bully to brilliant student. In choosing to play a starchy, no-nonsense feminist and teacher in The Corn Is Green, a woman who scorns conventional romantic love and marriage, Davis was offering a kind of rebuke to Curtiz, who had been dismissive and tyrannical with her in the past, calling her a “no-good-sexless-son-of-a-bitch” on the set of The Cabin in the Cotton (1932).
