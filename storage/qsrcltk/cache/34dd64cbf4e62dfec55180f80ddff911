Post-irony and the afflictive American self in David Foster Wallace’s Literary Non-Fiction, The Sovereign Individual: What You Need to Know & Why. In this �new kind of democratic art�, the reader takes up new roles, as evidenced by her analysis of Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.� Laura Kreyder gave a brilliant talk on the use of Qu�b�cois French in Infinite Jest. She brilliantly analysed for instance the evolution of the term used to describe the A.F.R. As much as we (and Wallace) may want to dismiss its importance to his work, it is a key entry-point to understanding Wallace as a writer and public figure because the bandanna illustrates, in miniature, one of the biggest motifs of Wallace’s writing, one that he felt captures what it means to be alive in America today: the double-bind.

It is hard not to agree. That’s a double-bind, Wallace style. In Comparative Literature courses, a number of us read works by Wallace and … Perhaps Wallace explains it best when he tells Lipsky that he views it as “a foible… the recognition of a weakness.” If there’s anything that passionately draws readers to Wallace, it’s not the grungy Gen-X iconography of the bandanna, it’s what the bandanna represents: a deeply empathetic recognition of the foibles and weaknesses that we all share in being alive in these United States of Double-Binds. Marshall Boswell�s plenary talk was a fascinating exploration of Jeffrey Eugenides� The Marriage Plot as a key text for analysing DFW�s influence on contemporary fiction. He emphasized that the plagiarism recounted in The Pale King, being the first instance where the author had to adopt authorial names which were not his own, was the first event in a sequence which would ultimately result in the complete replacement of DW by DFW.

He demonstrated that the �gentle giant� Leonard Bankhead was heavily inspired by DFW: his bandana, chewing tobacco habit, appearance, softness, delicacy of tone and wallacesque language (with almost verbatim quotations of things said by DFW during public readings � �where�s my saliva?�), as well as references to Goethe�s Werther (DFW signing his letters to Mary Karr as �Young Werther�, cf her memoir Lit). OCTOBER 27--Author David Foster Wallace bound his wrists with duct tape before hanging himself from a patio roof rafter in the backyard of … Teacher.
