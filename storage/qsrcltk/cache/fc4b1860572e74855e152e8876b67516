The Chinese giant salamander species complex comprises five clades, with multiple possibly worthy of species recognition. Finds in Taiwan may be the result of introduction. In 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) initiated a three-year Darwin-funded project to conserve the Critically Endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus, CGS).Our overall goal was to build long-term research and conservation capacity within China and to stop this species from going extinct in the wild. Wiki User Answered 2012-08-07 07:44:37. This new structure was able to establish new regulations that aimed at being successful in educating the masses about the value and significance of nature conservation, promoting awareness on the present status of various species, as well as prohibiting anti-conservation efforts such as hunting and trading of protected species such as the Chinese giant salamander. Establishments such as restaurants can charge up to US$250–US$400 per kilogram. Similar... See full answer below. Presumably ingested by mistake, plant material and gravel have also been found in their stomachs. This species is endemic to mountain rivers and lakes in China.

The breeding season is July, August, and September when the water temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and they travel upstream. The Chinese giant salamander produces sounds that resemble a baby’s cry, earning it the ironic (and inaccurate) nickname “baby fish.”. Videos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations. [36][37] The female hatches her eggs, which are later fertilized by the male - we'll go over this process below. [4] Presumably ingested by mistake, plant material and gravel have also been found in their stomachs. The Hellbender lives in the eastern United States. As larvae, they have gills, but lose them quite early in life. [1] Chinese giant salamanders have been introduced to the Kyoto Prefecture in Japan where they present a threat to the native Japanese giant salamander, as the two hybridize. It has been put on the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and it is under state protection in China. As of 2019, London Zoo holds four individuals (one of them on display) that were seized from an illegal importation of amphibians in 2016. Despite the Chinese Government listing the salamander as a Class II Protected Species, 100 salamanders are hunted illegally every year in the Hupingshan Natural Nature Reserve alone. [13] It can reach up to 50 kg (110 lb) in weight and 1.8 m (5.9 ft) in length, making it the second-largest amphibian species,[3][14] after the South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi). Farms have generally not considered this issue when releasing giant salamanders and Yellow River animals now dominate in some regions outside their original range, further endangering the native types. In 1989, the Chinese government placed legal protection on the salamander (category II due to its population decline by The Wild Animal Protection Law of China and Appendix I in the Convention of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna.[36][37]). The smallest individuals live from one to several years. Larvae develop in the streams, taking food after about a month. In addition, salamander farms would need to increase their yield manifold before the black-market price of poached salamander drop significantly, meaning that a stricter enforcement of anti-poaching law is still very much the future for the Chinese giant salamander. Don’t cry. Males may defend an underwater den where females can lay their strings of eggs, and he will fertilize them and protect them area until they hatch. They are easy to hunt, so catching them is not a problem. See Answer. Few believe that even with the major losses already suffered, the situation can still be turned around through proper protection of the Chinese giant salamander habitats, nesting sites, prevention of pollution from surface runoff, banning of certain hunting methods, and an assessment of irrigation work with nature reserves. [3] When laid, the eggs measure 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) in diameter, but they increase to about double that size by absorbing water. Autoplay is paused. Endemic to China, this salamander is now farmed for its meat throughout the country, but it remains severely threatened. The main attraction is the largest individual in Europe, which is 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) long. [28] A medium-sized individual, approximately 0.9 m (3 ft) long, was kept for several years at the Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California, and is now on display again in the "Water Planet" section of the new California Academy of Sciences building. Megalobatrachus davidianus (Reviewed by Liu, 1950)[2], The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is one of the largest salamanders and one of the largest amphibians in the world. They were widespread in central, south-western and southern China, although their range is now highly fragmented. [4] As a consequence, the species is vulnerable to global warming.[4]. The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a "living fossil". [1] Since the 1950s, the population has declined rapidly due to habitat destruction and overhunting. Salamander larvae are born between 12 and 15 weeks after being fertilized, that is, three to four - in the early spring. Demand for exotic food has pushed the world's largest amphibian, the Chinese giant salamander, to the brink of extinction in the wild. Unlike many other salamanders, these creatures do not leave the water. [22], In recent years populations have also declined with an epizootic Ranavirus infection. Despite this, the population continues to decline with the salamanders becoming increasingly difficult to find. To understand the conservation efforts in China, it is important to know something about the events of the several past hundred years of China's history relating to social attitudes, pressures on nature and natural resources, and the political ambition to safeguard the natural environment. [4], Both sexes maintain a territory, averaging 40 m2 (430 sq ft) for males and 30 m2 (320 sq ft) for females. In a recent survey of the species in the Qinghai Province, none were found indicating the population size is at a significantly low number or the species is locally extinct in the province. It has been listed as Critically Endangered in the Chinese Red Book of Amphibians and Reptiles. [11] Siltation also contributes to the degradation of their habitats by soiling the water. An international team of scientists conducted an intense, four-year survey that covered 97 sites across 16 Chinese provinces of prime freshwater amphibian habitat in China. [20] These algal blooms also deplete the levels of oxygen in the water, and a lesser supply of oxygen can quite easily hold the potential to kill off many members of the dwindling species. The base in Jing'an County, in the eastern province of Jiangxi, will breed the amphibians for scientific research, the traditional Chinese medicine industry and for exhibition in aquariums. It is found in fast-moving, freshwater mountain streams. By supporting San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, you are our ally in saving and protecting wildlife worldwide. They feed on fish, insects, crustaceans and small mammals. [11] Its color is typically dark brown with a mottled or speckled pattern, but it can also be other brownish tones, dark reddish, or black. They diverged from each other 4.71–10.25 million years ago and should possibly be recognized as cryptic species. Temperatures of 35 °C (95 °F) are lethal to Chinese giant salamanders. [9] It has also been given the moniker of "living fossil" for being part of the family Cryptobranchidae which dates back 170 million years. [6] It is one of only four to five known extant species of the family, the others being the slightly smaller, but otherwise very similar Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus), the slightly larger South China giant salamander (A. sligoi), an undescribed species from eastern China, and the far smaller North American hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis). All these species are endangered because their population is declining or their geographic distribution is becoming restricted. Hook, line, and sinker. Distribution of the Giant Salamander.
