Jane Fonda, Henry Fonda, Natalie Wood, and Olivia de Havilland were among the performers who paid tribute, with de Havilland commenting that Davis "got the roles I always wanted". Davis reportedly loathed the script, and begged Warner to recast the role, but he refused. The televised event included comments from several of Davis' colleagues, including William Wyler, who joked that given the chance, Davis would still like to re-film a scene from The Letter to which Davis nodded. "[41] Davis lost the case,[42] and returned to Hollywood, in debt and without income, to resume her career. Davis' performance in Of Human Bondage (1934) was widely acclaimed and, when she was not nominated for an Academy Award, several influential people mounted a campaign to have her name included. With her health stable, she traveled to England to film the Agatha Christie mystery Murder with Mirrors (1985). It was originally recorded by the latter in that year but was made popular by American singer Kim Carnes in 1981 when it spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot 100. [56], Davis showed little interest in the film Now, Voyager (1942), until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. [14] In 1929, Davis was chosen by Blanche Yurka to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play in The Wild Duck. Oh, I thought I would die. [118], She was entombed in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, alongside her mother Ruthie and sister Bobby, with her name in larger type size. For her performance in the film, she was awarded the Volpi Cup at the 1937 Venice Film Festival. The others were for Dark Victory (1939), The Letter (1940), The Little Foxes (1941) and Now, Voyager (1942). Upon her return, she learned that Hyman had published My Mother's Keeper, in which she chronicled a difficult mother-daughter relationship and depicted scenes of Davis’ overbearing and drunken behavior.[4]. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant Kathryn Sermak gained partial recovery from the paralysis. By this time, her health was failing, and after disagreements with Cohen, she walked off the set. [5] Davis' younger sister was Barbara Harriet.[6]. Eventually, Davis brought her case to court in Britain, hoping to get out of her contract.

[citation needed], Universal Studios renewed her contract for three months, and she appeared in a small role in Waterloo Bridge (1931), before being lent to Columbia Pictures for The Menace, and to Capital Films for Hell's House (all 1932). [78] Hedda Hopper wrote: "If Bette had deliberately set out to wreck her career, she could not have picked a more appropriate vehicle. Shopping. Davis’ adopted son Michael Merrill ended contact with Hyman, and refused to speak to her again, as did Davis, who disinherited her. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented: "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.". Music video tribute to Bette Davis I filmed with my Super 8 camera in the 80's when Kim Carnes first recorded her hit recording of "Bette Davis Eyes." Though in poor health at the time, Davis memorized her own and everyone else's lines as she always had. Joan Crawford played her role in Possessed, and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. When Davis was nominated for an Academy Award, Crawford contacted the other Best Actress nominees (who were unable to attend the ceremonies) and offered to accept the award on their behalf, should they win. The part had been played in the theatre by Ethel Barrymore (who was 61 at the play's premiere), but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. [64], She concluded that "the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving" kept the focus on the teacher's "sheer joy in imparting knowledge". 26 on the Dance charts. Joan said Bette was a “fascinating actress” but they were never able to become friends as they only worked on the one film together. [106], In 1977, Davis became the first woman to receive the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. After appearing on Broadway in New York, the 22-year old Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930. Davis and Merrill together adopted two children, Margo and Michael. [44] The film was a success, and Davis' performance as a spoiled Southern belle earned her a second Academy Award. The song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon, the latter of whom recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement. "[12] She auditioned for admission to Eva Le Gallienne's Manhattan Civic Repertory, but was rejected by Le Gallienne, who described her attitude as "insincere" and "frivolous". [60] It was released as a single in Australia on March 26, 2001,[61] debuting and peaking at number three on the ARIA Singles Chart on April 8, 2001. If she was presented as "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high", that is all the audience "would see or care about". [43] Her next picture was Jezebel (1938), and during production, Davis entered a relationship with director William Wyler. The bulk of her remaining work was for television. Warner replied: "Yes, she must play it. Davis collapsed during the American Cinema Awards in 1989, and later discovered that her cancer had returned. The criterion for her choice of film would appear to be that nothing must compete with the full display of each facet of the Davis art. "[26], The film was a success, and Davis' characterization earned praise from critics, with Life writing that she gave "probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. [94] Outside of acting and politics, Davis was an active and practicing Episcopalian. She also received the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award as Best Actress, having been named by them as the Worst Actress of 1949 for Beyond the Forest. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. One such story describes Crawford putting heavy weights in her pockets to make it hard for Bette to drag her on the floor in one scene. He mocked Davis' description of her contract as "slavery" by stating, incorrectly, that she was being paid $1,350 per week. Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film Mr. Skeffington (1944), but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth's death, convinced her to continue. Davis appeared in the television film As Summers Die (1986), and in Lindsay Anderson’s film The Whales of August (1987), in which she played the blind sister of Lillian Gish. In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis' eyes, and passes one to her.

[88], In the early 1970s, Davis was invited to appear in New York City in a stage presentation titled Great Ladies of the American Cinema. She accepted roles in the television miniseries The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978) and the theatrical film Death on the Nile (1978), an Agatha Christie murder mystery. Davis felt that Hopkins tried to upstage her throughout the film. [112], After abandoning Wicked Stepmother and with no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman’s The Turn of the Century and worked with him on adapting the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows, and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King, and David Letterman, discussing her career, but refusing to discuss her daughter.
