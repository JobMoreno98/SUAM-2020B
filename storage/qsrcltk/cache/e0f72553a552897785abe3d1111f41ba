[88], By 1983, the relationship between Hinault and Guimard had deteriorated to a point where the former described their relationship as "war". Joseph Hinault relented only after his son ran away from home for three days to stay with his cousins, sleeping on straw in the barn. At a race in Hillion, he and René escaped from the field and reached the finish alone. It was just brutal. The team time trial on stage 4 again went Zoetemelk's way, as his Mercier team took back 41 seconds on Hinault's Renault squad. "[35] In all, Hinault won five stages of the Vuelta. In the 1986 Tour de France, he engaged in an intra-team rivalry with LeMond, who won his first of three Tours. Six days before the race started, he had won La Flèche Wallonne for a second time.

On the last lap, he dropped his last companion, Gianbattista Baronchelli, on the steepest part of a climb and soloed to victory. Following a fourth place at the prologue in Genoa, Hinault made a spontaneous visit to Fausto Coppi's home of Castellania, paying respect to the first rider ever to have won Giro and Tour in the same year.

At the Dauphiné Libéré, he came second to Martín Ramírez, who later claimed that Hinault and his team had tried to intimidate him during the final stage of the race. Hinault was now in the lead of the general classification, 5:25 minutes ahead of LeMond. He then won the Giro di Lombardia for a second time, breaking away from the group of favourites 10 km (6.2 mi) from the finish. [98] Together, they entered the Giro d'Italia. [32] Hinault started the season with second place at Paris–Nice. Up the finishing climb in Grenoble, he briefly dismounted, still shocked from the near-death experience and pushed his bike for about 20 m (22 yd), before remounting and winning the stage eighty seconds ahead of Van Impe. After winning the 1983 Vuelta a España, a return of his knee problems forced him to miss that year's Tour de France, won by his teammate Laurent Fignon. Hinault, joined by Lejarreta and Vicente Belda, escaped for 80 km (50 mi), distancing Gorospe by over twenty minutes with Hinault taking victory in Ávila, sealing his second Vuelta victory.

Le Guilloux used it once in front of Pierre Chany, a writer for L'Équipe, and the name stuck. [42] Hinault countered the next day en route to Saint-Étienne during stage 15, breaking away with Hennie Kuiper. [70] One-and-a-half weeks earlier, he had already added a victory at the Amstel Gold Race. The time LeMond waited may have been enough so that the two teammates would have contested the Maillot Jaune in the penultimate time trial. [58] With his tendinitis worsening, he carried on until the end of stage 12, just before the race was headed for the first high mountains in the Pyrenees. Zwischen 1978 und 1985 konnte der von der französischen Bevölkerung aufgrund seiner taktischen Cleverness Le Blaireau („der Dachs“) genannte Hinault als dritter Fahrer überhaupt fünf Siege bei der Tour de France  erringen.

He led the way up the climb, lined by approximately 300,000 spectators and crossed the finish line hand in hand with LeMond, in an apparent display of comradery. By 1982, debates about his personality started to appear more and more in the media. The most prominent race of this character, Paris–Roubaix, was met with particular disdain, even though he never finished lower than thirteenth.

He bounced back at the La Flèche Wallonne classic in April, when he caught up to a breakaway by Giuseppe Saronni and Bernt Johansson, outsprinting the former to win the race. Hinault then cracked, coming in ninth, 4:39 minutes behind stage winner LeMond. [135] His enigmatic exit from the 1980 Tour created tensions with the press that would persist during the rest of his active career. [138], Hinault was not known to particularly enjoy going on training rides, unless he was specifically preparing for an event. When they reached the finishing town, they dismounted their bikes and walked to the finish line in protest.

[80] Zoetemelk was again the runner-up, more than six minutes behind Hinault.

He ensured his overall victory by winning stage 18 to Amurrio. [99], In the Tour de France, Fignon did not take part due to an Achilles heel injury. Included in his duties was being present during podium ceremonies. During the 1980 Tour de France, he sought to remove the rule which excluded riders outside the time limit on each stage. [8], Hinault never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during his professional career and was never implicated in any doping practices. [27] Five days later, at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Hinault followed an attack by favourite André Dierickx, and beat him in the two-man sprint to take his first victory in one of cycling's "monuments". Hinault started cycling as an amateur in his native Brittany. A five-time winner of the prestigious Tour de France, he is also one of the only six cyclists to have won all three Grand Tours: Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España. [150] He did, however, lead a riders' protest during a criterium race in Callac in 1982 against the sudden introduction of doping controls. Hinault therefore entered the race as the favourite. [125], Hinault never became a directeur sportif, leading a team, after his active career, as did many of his competitors. Journalist Felix Magowan wrote: "Before today's strike, people were asking if the Tour had a boss. Offers from Bouygues Télécom and a Chinese investor in the mid-2000s fell through. With 147 professional victories,[1] including five in the Tour de France, he is often named among the greatest cyclists of all time. At a criterium race in August 1975 he went up against a coalition of senior riders, who had decided to divide the prize money between them. [96], Hinaut managed to bounce back from his Tour defeat in the fall. [21] His results in his first season were impressive, with a seventh place at Paris–Nice and a victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe, earning him the Promotion Pernod, the prize for the best new professional in France. Particular interest was given to an alleged lack of panache during his Tour wins and his behaviour towards fans and officials, whom he treated with open disgust. [37], In the Tour de France, Hinault fell behind early to challenger Zoetemelk when Renault lost two minutes to Mercier during the team time trial. The team decided to stick with their directeur sportif, leading Hinault to search for a new team. On stage 5, a time trial to Pisa, Hinault took over the race leader's pink jersey. [145], Hinault was nicknamed le blaireau in French, a term that can be translated into English as either "the shaving brush" or "the badger". [128] In this role, Hinault would use his influence with race organisers, control the pace of the peloton, and allow or refuse other riders the chance to attack. [140] Unlike a rider like Eddy Merckx, Hinault would not aim to win every race he entered. [44], The 1979 season started slowly for an off-form Hinault. Half hopes became quarter hopes in exactly 8 minutes and 47 seconds, the time it took Hinault to fly around the opening 6.8 km prologue time trial. At that moment the French TV audience had every reason to assume that he was lying down there with a broken back. I'm afraid, and for good reason. [75], At the World Championship in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Hinault failed to defend his title. He had, already in 1982, announced that he would retire from cycling on his 32nd birthday, in November 1986. Four years later, in 1978, Hinault won the French national championships before clinching a Tour/Vuelta double later in the season, all before his 24th birthday. He added another Tour victory in 1981, before completing his first Giro-Tour double in 1982. He then travelled to the French Road Race Championship, held at Sarrebourg. The two exchanged attacks on the way up the climb, but it was in the valley that Hinault was able to draw out a gap of about a minute. However, the Spaniard was unable to follow his wheel, saying: "This guy has made me suffer like a dog, he's tougher than Eddy Merckx! And Hinault went on to play a pivotal role in LeMond’s career, recruiting him to his Renault team and pushing him to the first-ever Tour de France victory by an American. Hinault himself had sand thrown into his eyes, but won the stage nonetheless, only to find that the results would not count due to the surrounding circumstances.
