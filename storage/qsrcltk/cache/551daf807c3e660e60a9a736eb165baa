Thank you, Seinior Citizens who can’t Handle Change. It pops! A big change like getting rid of people’s content might be worth a heads up…. This is horrible. I’ve already deleted the app from my phone (in favor of m.facebook.com) and FaceBook should recognize when to leave well enough alone. I hate this! It’s not available here. Also not on my drop down menu. And where the hell do you log out? Facebook stop letting me revert back to the NICE Classic version so…. Sadly, politicians and journalists are willling to regard this bubble as a representation of society; in some cases, perhaps, because they fit into it very well. The new Facebook layout will be widely released sometime this year. Most comments here seem to have missed the point. Why can’t my friends see them? Big times ! Facebook Stories have also been moved above the status update box. It looks childish and stupid. It also included a more prominent “Follow” button for easier access. I used it on Chrome and it worked instantly after I installed it. quit being absurd. The users are NOT the clients they are the commodity! The option to upload pics to an album as part of a new post is gone as are the options for making a selected photo your cover pic, profile pic, etc. has Facebook canceled this new look? Twitter got so much right with their new website but effed everything up when they changed the layout last minute. There is no switch back to classic facebook on my screen.. i searched found 3 different sites and 3 different ways to switch it back according to them.. and NONE of them work.. Facebook have removed those ways of doing it. It’s a crappy mobile layout that wastes a lot of space. I hate it.. there is no “change back to the classic” on my drop down menu but there is on my husbands and he has other options too.. How ’bout THEM apples eh?. They work with us on our website, blogs, and social media. HORRIBLE!! Can you tell me how you did it? I read on another site that a number of people globally are not being the option to switch back because they’re part of a test group. Unable to perform functions the old one allows. @Addy T. Hatespeech, that’s code for anyone who opposses the globalists. I do not like it, because you cannot depend on it working!!!  It gives me a headache just looking at the screen! There is nothing to like about the new look Facebook at all. YEAH, click on it ALL day and it just keeps taking you back to your page. Evidently, 1 in 3 people are “narcissists and … mentally ill”. Click on the down arrow in the top right. And if you want to keep Classic Facebook for as long as possible, you can switch back by doing the same thing at any time! I hate this new design. Just go to your quick settings button, which is the down arrow on the top right-hand of your screen. Forget about the painting I was going to make. . To restore classic Facebook, do the following: Now You: how do you like the new Facebook design? It is awful!!! I will miss updated from friends big-time! Get me off this New F/book Or I will leave period. More useless whitespace, huge fonts, clear text labels replaced by only icons, making it intentionally harder to understand. How do i get classic back without this option to click on? If I clock on anything at the top where my profile picture is, it opens a new tab and depicts nothing. Not a happy camper with the new Facebook format I found on my desktop when I signed in after a week not being able to get to it and when I click on the down arrow the option to revert back is not there, now what – I need the old format back. 2.5 Billion FB users in a 7.7 Billion person world. Thanks. The interface matters little as long as there’s easy access to their endorphin pump buttons. I don’t see a Menu icon anywhere, so have to deal with the bright white screen. It looks like a nightmare!!! AND I WON’T NEED A ‘MOBILE AP’ as I do everything from my desktop keyboards. The most notable change to Facebook Page layouts … There’s a hope that people will be able to quickly navigate to what they want, rather than climbing through a mountain of information. The page will refresh and the new interface design will load. I post the same type of comments every day! What’s wrong with the designers??????????? Want to know what happens with your pictures uploaded to Facebook? I hate it. Select “Edit Page” from the left sidebar menu. ok im saying for those who have bad eye site this new look of Facebook look’s awesome you remember things never last forever things do change you ppl may not like change but i say those who don’t like change need to know were lucky to have Facebook or the internet there are those who remember when there was no internet so be happy we have anything at all i love Facebook and always will if they get rid of the classic Facebook remember change is a good thing just takes time to learn how to use the new Facebook page it took me awhile but i got it figured out no need to get upset and panic those who complain about the new look need to remember that there was a time when we had no facebook at all and complaining gets nothing but ppl upset i admit i was confused at first but now i can use this facebook page have fun why complain why get mad about the new look once you figure out how to use the new page your ready to go have fun i feel sorry for them who have problems with anything just embrace change and remember Tecnology changes all the time to try to make things better for everyone i for one once i learn how to do some thing i am happy cause i learned some thing new and ppl need to learn new things so i close here by saying learn to do things you never done before because learning new thing can be fun once you learn to use the new page on facebook you can start having more fun im never giving up on Facebook i love Facebook i even use Messenger to keep in touch with Family and Friend me and my Sister use messenger and don’t even use the phone so Embrace and learn some thing new don’t give up on Facebook you give up before you even start you may be left out in the cold before you try these changes and your giving up on change not sure how things will be able to do next but remember there even getting rid of Flash at the end of December things will change once again and we need to embrace change one again were all lucky to have anything like Facebook so don’t give up before you have given Facebook a chance those who don’t embrace change are those who are missing out while others move ahead and learn that chance can an will get better as they work on making things better fore every one change can be fun once you get use to it so have a great day and don’t give up on Facebook, OMG !

None of my friends seem to see my posts now, before the switch, I always got “likes” and comments from my friends. Now it looks like the social media juggernaut is set to wide-release the layout any time now. In the “Settings” menu of your Facebook Page, you’ll see a tab called “Edit Page”. Since I have not been given the option to switch back to the old classic version of Facebook, I have no choice but to leave Facebook for good. I switched to the new Facebook, did not like it and now you cannot switch back, so I quit Facebook. Therefore, bye-bye Facebook. There is a new site called “MeWe” that I have signed up to. Because of this focus on the app, one of the biggest changes to the desktop site is the positioning of the entire page. Note that Facebook changed the design recently, you may need to click on the down-arrow icon instead to display the menu. In the dropdown box the option to go back to the old version of FB is not there! And it’s no wonder either. Speaking of Duplo winning over Lego; well they did need to keep their technicians in India worth keeping right! It is like the messages are not even going through. I hate the layout and frickin’ huge font on my PC. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY “NO OPTION” OFFERED TO “SWITCH BACK” TO THE ORIGINAL INTERFACE !!! just saying. This takes you inside some of the new or updated … Nothing works and no option to go back to older version. Same thing here; I hate the new look but don’t have the option to go back now! most people, like myself, center their subject so that it appears – yep, right in the middle, thus their new format trashs your cover photo (unless you really like the edges and don’t give a crap about what’s in the middle – probably 99.99999999% (or more) of the time, this isn’t the case. We just want the content. Some longer posts took 2 screens to display all contents. Looks like it’s time to switch to MeWe or Vk! Wont use it until the old fromat is not available. All Facebook profile pages have a similar layout, for a uniform look and feel. That does the trick! Facebook has been pumping resources into its mobile app for years. mind doesnt say switch back to old facebook which is bs i want old facebook but they wont let me im thinking of finding another site i hate new facebook.
