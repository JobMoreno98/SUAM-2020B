The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Geospatial Program is scanning published USGS 1:250,000-scale and larger topographic maps printed between 1884, the inception of the topographic mapping program, and 2006. What is a Topographic Map? As you can see in this image, a topographic map uses lines to determine the heights of features such as mountains and valleys. Introduction; 1928; B; 788; Birdseye, Claude Hale, Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), Mapping, Remote Sensing, and Geospatial Data. Topographic maps represent the locations of geographical features, such as hills and valleys. A topographic map is a detailed and accurate illustration of man-made and natural features on the ground such as roads, railways, power transmission lines, contours, … ; 1994; USGS Unnumbered Series; GIP; U.S. Geological Survey, Exploring maps; 1993; USGS Unnumbered Series; GIP; U.S. Geological Survey. The first US Topo maps were published in 2009. From these maps, you can determine the appearance of a landscape (hills, valleys, depressions, etc.). This can be calculated by dividing the difference between the two known elevations by the number of contour lines in between. The topographic map is a two-dimensional representation of the Earth’s three-dimensional landscape. These maps describe the shape of the land. US Topo is the next generation of topographic maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). A science of topography: From qualitative ontology to digital representations ... 24,000 topographic map, it is up to the map reader to determine what feature, point, or region the words "Mount Washington" refer to. transmission lines, contours, elevations, rivers, lakes and geographical names. representation of the Earth’s three-dimensional .

To help resolve this problem, scientists and anyone interested in the shape of the earth, rely on topographic maps – a tool that shows changes in elevation and surface features (roads, buildings, rivers, etc.) Repeat this process for each circle. A topographic map tells you where things are and how to get to them, whether you're hiking, biking, hunting, fishing, or just interested in the world around you. If the lines are close together, the change in elevation happens very quickly, indicating a steep terrain. Some contour lines will have their elevation marked next to them, but not all. Topographic maps supply a general image of the earth's surface: roads, rivers, buildings, often the nature of the vegetation, the relief and the names of the various mapped objects." The US Topo production schedule follows the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) collection schedule. If the distance between the lines is very far apart, that indicates a gradual increase in elevation. The differences are often minor. These maps are used for a number of applications, from camping, hunting, fishing, and hiking to urban planning, resource management, and surveying. They should look a bit like a hill. Elevation contours are imaginary lines connecting points having the same elevation on the surface of the land above or below a reference surface, which is usually mean sea level. 1) Begin by using the cardboard to build an imaginary terrain. 5) You now have a topographic map of the terrain that you created!
