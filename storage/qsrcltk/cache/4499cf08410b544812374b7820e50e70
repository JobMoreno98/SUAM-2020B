The A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter is a fictional Rebel Alliance and New Republic starfighter. [27][28]  With its hyperdrive and five day's worth of supplies, the ARC-170 can operate deep behind enemy lines, where the variety of scanners and sensor jammers in its heavy nose help it conduct dangerous scouting missions. Lacking an internal hyperdrive, the Jedi starfighter uses an external hyperspace transport wing to which it can attach for faster-than-light travel. Rebel mechanics and technicians transformed their U-wings into sturdy gunships and troop transports for Rebel Alliance Special Forces (SpecForces) making dangerous insertions into Imperial territory. [36]  While these fighters are said to possess tremendous acceleration and maneuverability thanks to a unique engine mount (also magnetically suspended), few of these fighters are exported as they are designed specifically around Geonosian senses and dexterity to operate.

It is the second film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Rey Skywalker, once known only as Rey, was a human female Jedi Master who fought on the side of the Resistance in the war against the First Order.A former scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New Republic Era.Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, … [34]  Formally known as the Nantex-class starfighter and produced by the Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwrights Collective, the Geonosian fighter is 9.8 m (32 ft) long, 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in) wide and 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) tall (excluding the cockpit bubble). [37]  In the 2003 Clone Wars animated series, Anakin Skywalker is seen flying a customized Delta-7, called the Azure Angel, of which a Lego model was later made. The Naboo N-1 Starfighter made its theatrical appearance in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. [1][3]  Repulsorlifts are carried as secondary drives for atmospheric flight and when docking or making planetary landings. [37][41]  Manufactured for the Jedi by Kuat Systems Engineering, the starfighter measures just 8 m (26 ft) long, 3.92 m (12.9 ft) wide and 1.44 m (4 ft 9 in) high, making it difficult to detect. - 91% of the 2,880 user reviews for this game are positive. Both Kenner and Hasbro released B-wing toys,[15][16] the B-wing is part of two Micro Machines three-packs,[17][18] and Lego has made several B-wing sets.

TIE fighters—and variants such as TIE interceptors and TIE bombers—appear throughout the original trilogy. It is not to be confused with, Starfighters appearing in the Original Trilogy, Starfighters appearing in the Prequel Trilogy, Becraft, A., Malloy, C. (2017). [27], After the end of the Clone Wars, the ARC-170 would continue to serve under the Galactic Empire until replaced in favor of the TIE Fighter. [72], Director Gareth Edwards wanted Rogue One to be grounded in the aesthetics of the Korean or Vietnam War in order to contrast it with the more World War II look of the original Star Wars film.

[49] A life-size model of a Naboo Starfighter hangs suspended from the ceiling of the Blue Wing at the Boston Museum of Science, in Boston, Massachusetts. Although featured in a full two-page spread in the Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections book, the fighter's role was significantly reduced in the final film. Although initial plans called for B-wings to appear in several scenes, its narrow appearance from some angles made it difficult to see against the backdrop of space. [23][24] The second expansion pack for the X-Wing flight simulator, B-Wing, introduces the B-wing as a playable starfighter; several other LucasArts products also depict B-wings.

When the Jedi were destroyed after Order 66, Kuat Systems Engineering designed a new starfighter that would be more manageable for non-Jedi pilots: the A-wing. This was due to the fact that the P-38's digital model, being a late addition to the film, was not completed to the level originally planned, and so was relegated to a background craft. With a history dating back thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi — noted for their lightsabers and natural ability to harness the powers of the Force — stood as the guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The B-wing featured S-foils similar in function to those of the X-wing fighter.[10][14]. The Republic commissioned upgraded models of the Z-95 for their clone pilots which featured more powerful weaponry and deflector shields, as well as superior endurance and adaptability. The pilot has to wear a pressurized suit, as TIE fighters also lack life support systems. Measuring 5.4 m (18 ft) long, with a 1.96 m (6 ft 5 in) wingspan and 3.45 m (11.3 ft) width, its in-universe manufacturer are the Colicoids, the same species which produced Droideka. The Kuat RZ-1 A-wing Interceptor is a class of starfighter, depicted as fast but fragile interceptors of the Rebel Alliance, conceived for high-speed surgical strikes, deep reconnaissance and escort fighter duty. [41]  A pair of laser cannons and deflector shielding allows the Jedi pilot to engage in combat, though ideally as a last resort. In order to represent the idea of three vulture droids sharing one "brain," animators purposefully linked the motion of each three-ship flight when creating the climactic battle of The Phantom Menace. © 2002-2017 Lucasfilm Entertainment Company Ltd. or Lucasfilm Ltd.  All rights reserved. [28][63]  At 3.5 m (11 ft) long when in flight mode, these droid starfighters are designed to engage the enemy in overwhelming swarms, partially to overcome their lack of cunning and resourcefulness. Originally, animation director Rob Coleman proposed that TIE Fighters be featured to signify this transition, but George Lucas pointed out that (in the film's chronology) there were nineteen years between the events of Revenge of the Sith and the original Star Wars. [48]  Additionally, folding wings on either side of the hull contain radiator panels to manage heat levels during intense activity. The U-wing's two laser cannons could be supplemented by a pair of infantry heavy weapons handled by dedicated door gunners. When necessary, the droid can uses its repulsorlifts to land and transform into a four-legged walking configuration to occupy territory, angling its energy torpedo launchers for antipersonnel use. All rights reserved. [73], In-universe material states that the UT-60 was the last starfighter design created by Incom Corporation before the company was nationalized by the Galactic Empire. [70], The UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft is a Rebel troop transport/gunship model manufactured by Incom Corporation for the purpose of supporting special operations forces insertion and extraction into denied areas from strategic distances. Later models were modified to be equipped with an internal hyperdrive.[76]. The U-wing's engine configuration was inspired in part by the X-wing, and like the X-wing featured S-foils but in a variable-sweep wing format, opening them to improve atmospheric maneuverability and enlarge its deflector shield. [27][29], Droid Tri-fighters are droid starfighters used by Separatist forces during the Clone Wars. Inspire memories of the classic Star Wars: Return of the Jedi movie with this cool Ultimate Collectors Series LEGO® A-wing Starfighter (75275) building set!The sleek, arrowhead shape is beautifully reproduced in LEGO bricks and fans will appreciate authentic details such as the pivoting laser cannons and new-for-May-2020 removable canopy on the cockpit.

We also carry a variety of collectibles from The Mandalorian, inluding … A variety of B-wing merchandise has been released by toy companies. [59][60]  The V-wing is far more maneuverable than the ARC-170, making it perfect for combating swarms of Tri-fighters and Vulture droids,[59] while a pair of powerful ion engines can propel the fighter to a top atmospheric speed of 52,000 km/h (32,000 mph). [79] The Z-95 is featured variously in the Expanded Universe, including the X-wing: Rogue Squadron comic series (c. 1996–1997), as well as in 2008's The Clone Wars television series, in which it is used by the Galactic Republic. It was released by Electronic Arts on November 15, 2019. Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, marketed as simply The Empire Strikes Back, is a 1980 film directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan from a story by George Lucas.It is the second film in the Star Wars original trilogy.. It made its theatrical debut, as the T-65B model, in Star Wars (1977) as the spacecraft piloted by Luke Skywalker and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the Death Star. [13] The A/SF-01 was the most well-armed starfighter in the galaxy at the time it was introduced; a single B-wing was capable of attacking and destroying enemy capital ships. Its Class 1 Hyperdrive allowed for extended reconnaissance missions and rapid strategic redeployment. [1][4]  Some starfighters are also equipped with an internal hyperdrive or connect to an external hyperdrive unit for faster-than-light travel. The Z-95 Headhunter is a class of starfighter which was first described in the Brian Daley's 1979 novel Han Solo at Stars' End as having swing-wings and a bubble cockpit. However, if the gyro-stabilization system was not kept in prime condition, it could fail under the tremendous pressure and lock up. Interact with legendary Star Wars characters such as Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian (featuring the voice of Billy Dee Williams as Lando.). Play on-line with 2-32 players or against a variety of AI Bots - and gain an additional 7 Force powers. The fighter technically first appeared as an unlockable vehicle in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, which was released approximately six months before The Phantom Menace, and was available as a playable vehicle in the video games Star Wars: Battle for Naboo and Star Wars: Starfighter. [50] This 1:1 scale model was unveiled at the museum in April 2004, as a prelude to the Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination exhibit. Two 18" maquettes of the vulture droid were built - one in ship mode and one in walking mode - to help create the digital model.

[27]  Its crew includes a pilot, a co-pilot/forward gunner, a tail gunner, and an astromech droid to act as navigator and make repairs. [53][54], The Porax-38 appears in Revenge of the Sith as a starfighter piloted by the native Utapauns during the Battle of Utapau. While experimenting with different models and names ("Z-wing, R-wing, Q-wing, etc. An astromech droid fits in an off-center socket on the port side of the Delta-7, but the tiny fighter's size requires the droid's body be modified in order to fit (later Delta-7B models place the socket in front of the cockpit to allow full-sized astromech units). Original plans to equip the fighters with boosters were abandoned when Lucas decided they were an unnecessary distraction in the already chaotic scene. However the ship was not designed for the tight turns necessary for dogfights, and while the U-wing did feature a hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel, extended operations with a full passenger compliment would quickly deplete the vessel's life support systems. [11] The ship's rotating cockpit stems from an initial design for the Millennium Falcon. A variant of the vulture droid is the Hyena Bomber Droid, with a larger, sturdier hull and larger wings. [35]  These projectors are used not only to grapple with other spacrcraft but to help maneuver the fighter by pulling or pushing against surrounding objects. [19][20][21] A Micro Machines Alpha Fleet package includes models both of the B-wing's film appearance and of an initial production design. It is also even more maneuverable with two ion engines that can deflect thrust up to 30 degrees.
