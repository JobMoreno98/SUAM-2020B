Now Kenesha has written and illustrated a children's book, Many Shapes of Clay: A Story of Healing. And it's been really funny because you and I offline -- off mic -- we talk obviously a lot about how we interact with our own social media. How do I develop that skill and are there resources that you use? Amid so many challenges, here are the practices, advice, and rituals we're bringing with us into 2021. Ann: It turns out people edit for different things. Are you also wondering how much money is the podcast: Call Your Girlfriend making on Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow Apr, 2021? . He just has a very specific aesthetic and a point-of-view and it's one of those appointment Instagram accounts for me where at the end of the day or if I'm feeling like I'm having a down day I just go and I scroll through it again because you should always be learning. And so I always thought that I was fully in control of that and watching how the algorithm works now or the tools that they're introducing, i.e. All the members take pseudonyms after dead women artists. And it's more at the forefront in the Hulu documentary which one of the things that that documentary posits is that this wouldn't have been possible in a kind of pre-Instagram influencer era. Male: The last 24 hours were unbelievable. You're like just follow animals only. Lara: The dragon lady. Everybody else's life is hard. This life is hard. But back to your question I think that I feel very conflicted about it. We talk with a paragon of creating cozy feelings, Jenny Han, the author behind the book and Netflix series To All the Boys I've Loved Before. A person in my extended friend group Niki Ford has a great Instagram account called Niki Ford Cooks which is just like little kitchen tips and good recipes. Yeah. And I think that's very, very, very important. That's who he chose and he was talking about her account and how down-to-earth she was and really goofy and just seemed like she's just a fun, laid-back person you know? Call Your Girlfriend bills itself as the podcast for long distance besties everywhere, but it’s also so much more. Fortunately, Rebecca Traister's work on the political power of women's anger is always timely, as we revisit our 2018 interview. And part of me is like well, I wish that we could teach this at scale and everybody could learn but at the same time the onus should not be on the individual users to feel that they have to do everything. . Lara: Oh my god, yes of course. Ann: Right, it's like your social media is really what's operative. The threshold's pretty low. Aminatou: Right, like have a specific point-of-view. [Laughs]. It's whatever you think your best self is, do it. . Do the best you can with what you have because people are out here struggling and the more public they live their lives the harder it actually is. . . Lara: It's like no kind of awareness, especially someone like that. Aminatou: Yeah, but especially the kids. Bustle: The ‘Call Your Girlfriend’ Co-Hosts On Maintaining Big Friendships In Hard Times. Call Your Girlfriend is a very popular podcast that has been reviewed by well-known sources such as Entertainment Weekly, Los Angeles Magazine, and Elle UK. And it is not the same thing for me as just sharing with my friends about my life anymore. I'm like I don't want to be somebody that people look at and think that I have it all together or that I'm somebody to aspire to. [Laughs] My life is a mess." We are enjoying this slow season, grateful for what we have and opening our wallets for those who experience food insecurity. We discuss the inauguration celebrity parade, the fallacy of calls for "unity," Melania's caftan, Bernie's mittens, and "We will be back in some form.". . The place where I feel usually the most conflicted is how I share about not me on the Internet, you know what I mean? The new year has already been more of a lot. ... We have sizing descriptions and more about the shirt on our instagram. I'm like my life is literally a mess. Co-hosted by BFFs Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow. Ann: Aww, silly lady brains can operate it. Or yes, I would like to find out about Tick Tock as well. [Laughter]. Would I have dinner with you alone at my house? I don't actually care how many people engage with it. . We revisit our interview with adrienne maree brown, author of Pleasure Activism, Emergent Strategy, and most recently, We Will Not Cancel Us. The one-and-only Anna Sale of Death, Sex and Money is here to talk us though it and her new book, Let's Talk About Hard Things. Website Facebook Twitter Subscribe to podcast. Lara: Oh yeah. Like not like this is how she's portraying herself but this is who she is, you know? Ann: Is that the answer? I'm like you don't have to be mean here; you can be an amazingly nice person. But the thing is we don't actually care about Fyre Fest. Ann: It is really just the trickery of capitalism for literally decades and decades and decades. And I thought you know what, if Woodstock could get through that and from a publicity perspective land where it did Fyre Festival can make it. Ann: Okay, I'm going to hit you with one of my personal big revelatory takeaways from that conversation. Ann: Yeah. It is both for many people. So I'm thinking not only of the question of stories which is a little bit different but overall what are your -- in a space like Instagram that is I think a little bit more undefined in terms of is it supposed to be private? Ann: One of my very oldest and dearest friends Lara Shipley is an assistant professor of photography at Michigan State University and she and I had a lot of conversations when she first started teaching the basically like photo 101 class there because in the past I think it was a class where people would learn how to like develop stuff in the dark room or maybe learn the rule of thirds in composing a photo. It's not like we have an innate sense of what is what we want to share. The only thing I ever want to hear is that the person I know who is smartest about a thing is making a thing so other people can read about it. A podcast for long distance besties everywhere. So really those topics, the family, the happy memories, positivity, right? And as a society we've kind of never discussed what is acceptable or not. It's cool. I mean I'm not trying to get you to condense an entire class that people pay good American public university dollars to take [Laughter] into a two-minute blurb but I am curious if it's like okay, I'm listening to you. Oh my god. Aminatou: Oh, and there are literally hundreds of behaviorists and engineers and marketers who they stay up at night wanting you to have a certain kind of behavior to a thing that they have built. Yeah, I mean John Berger, brilliant. Ann: Meaning what?

Like this whole debacle is born of this era of social media and this particular way that people engage with celebrity which is a thesis I don't fully agree with but you know that seen where they have two "influencers" -- I'm air quoting -- two influencers who attended Fyre Festival and they're interviewing them separately about essentially their jobs or their role as influencers? We’re reading fiction, nonfiction, essays and anxiety-producing novels. And I hope everybody has people close to them who are asking these real questions because it's not always pretty all the time.

Aminatou: Yeah, this cultural -- this [French accent] moment. Ann: You're like oh, turns out I already know this person. . . Two different people both kind of say like well, hmm . Nobody should have this much just junk on their phone that they're trying to get rid of. Tara Houska is Ojibwe, an attorney, an environmental and indigenous rights advocate, and has a long history on the land Line 3 would travel through.

Now Kenesha has written and illustrated a children's book, Many Shapes of Clay: A Story of Healing. What better time to be lifting up the people we love and growing together? It's happening.

We talk with a paragon of creating cozy feelings, Jenny Han, the author behind the book and Netflix series To All the Boys I've Loved Before. Who holds the various keys to our hearts and identities? Aminatou: You know what I mean? And so even though I am fine to post nice photos for my friends I feel a lot of conflicted feelings about having a visual platform be a primary work platform for me.

You don't want to trade with me. I like to eat the same things as Niki does so that's one reason it's great. I don't want to be anybody. But I do think the point about the speed at which it can happen, and I do think that it was made in kind of a clunky way but part of the point about -- that the Hulu documentary was trying to make is yeah, but it can also be engineered now more easily. But what I did not resolve after making that decision was I have now decided to make this a public kind of work platform frankly, like something that feels more akin to maybe how I would use Twitter and talk to other journalists. i.e. And I'm like yeah, no shit. And I think people will respect the space a little bit more which means I will have to spend less time deleting horrible things in comments or whatever which for the most part has been kind of true. And then I actually looked at the follower account one day and I was like oh, this is actually a lot of people. .

Ann: I thought that was a neighborhood in Paris. Plus, Aminatou's decision matrix and Ann's daily writing practice. Not everybody knows that when you tweet about something or someone quietly and you don't tag them, somebody responding to you and tagging that person in the conversation is snitching and it's wrong. See you on the Internet. Same thing happened on Twitter, happened on MySpace, happened on Friend ster. And I think that's so important when you're thinking about photography that we're not having to think about the way we're interpreting it; we're just interpreting.

How did you get through to this poor soul who loves Emilia Clarke so much? Aminatou: That was three years ago. If you're just following cute animals maybe it is a totally relaxing experience, you know? Ann: Right. They're editing, picking out, selecting this is the one I want to share. I mean maybe it's like the multi-photo slideshow of having the next photo be like hello, here is my bank account from 2013 and this is where I -- you know what I mean? Everything from political appeals to Instagram ads are pitching us on a vision of the future. But it's not.

And I was like wow, thank you for giving me that anxiety now because I didn't have it before. Lara: The Kodak Brownie, yeah. Our brain is inputting them in a really similar way. . And I would say also that one thing that was excellent about watching two documentaries about the same topic that were flawed in different ways is that it's a great opportunity for being a critical consumer of images and narrative which I think is also related to the idea of FOMO and whether you feel it when you are looking at your own Instagram. And then somehow, you know, some people just have Instagram boyfriends who take perfect photos of them and you think that's the real life. So I don't quite know. Even some famous art theorists and critics since the beginning of photography have just been like oh, it's a science.
