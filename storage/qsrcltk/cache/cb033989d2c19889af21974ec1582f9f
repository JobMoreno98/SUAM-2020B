Now’s let start our Kafka producer and see data being processed as a stream by our faust worker. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology; Faust: A library for building streaming applications in Python. It provides the functionality of a messaging system, but with a unique design. Analytical programs can be written in concise and elegant APIs in Java and Scala. Faust is a stream processing library, porting the ideas from Kafka Streams to Python.. The try to adapt but will be replaced eventually with technologies that are cloud native.
