[25][33], Amphibians and reptiles are more obtainable by the North American river otter during the spring and summer as a result of breeding activity, appropriate temperatures, and water supply for the prey. [25][32][33] Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. North American river otter inhabitation is affected by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. [1] They are now absent or rare in Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.). However, it is positively associated with the number of beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. River otters are not territorial, but individual North American river otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. [59], The North American river otter is considered a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. Free timed-entry Asia Trail/Panda Passes are required for the giant panda viewing. [30] However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp. On average, otters range from 36 to 50 inches long from their head to the tip of the tail. Regionally extinct throughout the Midwest and heavily populated areas in the east, several states have recently begun reintroduction programs. The U.S. is home to two species: the sea otter and the North American river otter. However, it is sensitive to pollution, and will disappear from tainted areas. [22], Like other otters, the North American river otter lives in a holt, or den, constructed in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. [15] North American river otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage. The claws are well-formed and facial vibrissae (about 5 mm (0.20 in) long) are present. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. River otters have been blamed for decimating game fish populations and are seen as a pest to eradicate by many game fishermen. North American river otters are not scavengers; they avoid consuming carrion. A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help halt the reduction in the overall population. River otters are aquatic mammals. North American River Otter Lontra canadensis . Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. ), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp. While river otters tend to live alone or in pairs, they often socialize in groups and are known for their playful behavior. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. Even when our gates are closed, we are still here, working as always to save species. Check the conservation status of the animals you hunt and use methods that don’t impact other animals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. North American river otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for North American beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, triangular projection. North American river otters, also called Canadian otters, have long, muscular, streamlined bodies with short legs and fully webbed feet bearing non-retractable claws. [4] Instances of North American river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. [15], In early spring, expectant mothers begin to look for a den where they can give birth. [15], North American river otters can produce a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. [15] The North American river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, keeping water from entering them. [49] Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the North American river otter in other regions of Colorado. River otters leave scent marks on vegetation within their home range. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. The pelage has a high luster and varies from light brown to black. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Different studies have placed the breeding season in winter, late spring and summer. The male otter is generally chased away until the young are weaned and old enough to leave the riverbank, at which time they may return and help raise the pups. Also, North American river otters have large molars used for crushing hard objects, such as the shells of molluscs. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs[3]), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. ), and other game fish during spawning. The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes. Because they have a low tolerance for polluted water, river otters are considered by some naturalists to be a good indicator, or "keystone," species of the quality of aquatic habitats. [25], The North American river otter is more social than most mustelids. While river otters tend to live alone or in pairs, they often socialize in groups and are known for their playful behavior. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. As recently as the mid-1980s, more than 30,000 pelts were harvested annually. Free timed-entry Asia Trail/Panda Passes are required for giant panda viewing. River otter may refer to: . The vulnerability and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. [31][33], Mammals are rarely consumed by North American river otters, and are not a major dietary component. [15] Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if the enforcement of water quality standards is not upheld. However, urbanization and pollution instigated reductions in range area. [15] Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. They glide on their bellies with their front paws by their sides. More Virtual Vitamin Z North American River Otters at the Detroit Zoo The Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat is home to three North American river otters. The kits open their eyes after 30–38 days. Because the North American river otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range. Their aquatic habitats can be both marine and fresh water: streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and marshes. [33], Adult North American river otters are capable of consuming 1 to 1.5 kilograms (2.2 to 3.3 lb) of fish per day. [33] Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. Some studies indicate that river otters pair for only a few months during the breeding season and have no further strong bonds. [28] This availability is influenced by the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat. [10], The North American river otter is a stocky animal of 5 to 14 kilograms (11 to 31 lb), with short legs, a muscular neck (no smaller than the head) and an elongated body that is broadest at the hips. [37] Cases where they've been ambushed and consumed by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have also been reportedly witnessed near the Arctic region. IUCN/SSC Otter Specialist Group Leading global otter conservation since 1974 The Otter Specialist Group (OSG) is part of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). [49] The few occurrences of mammals found in the North American river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). It has a long, slender body covered in brown, water proof fur. Starvation may occur due to excessive tooth damage. V North American River Otter Husbandry Notebook, 3 rd Edition . The face is short with small ears. They remain as a family unit for seven to eight months or until the birth of a new litter. The smell and hearing abilities of the North American river otter are acute. In Mexico, the North American river otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas. The otters migrated to North America and southwards again across the Panamanian Land Bridge, which formed 3 Mya. They spend a significant portion of the day scent marking territory by urinating, defecating, scratching and rubbing their scent glands on rocks and trees. Fertilized eggs will remain in diapause for 7-10 months before implanting - usually during late winter/early spring months. [25][34][36][49] Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, is used for stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion.

The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur. [30][32] They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. The otters experienced a steep … Both males and family groups travel drastically less during winter. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain. Fur of the North American river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. Jellies. [32] ), chubs (Semotilus spp. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the North American river otter, the deciding factor whether the North American river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish. River Nile, the world’s longest river at 4,258 miles, is the longest northward-flowing river. MRC 5516 They take advantage of any slippery slope for fun, whether it's a summer slide down a muddy hill or a winter thrill on snow and ice. With the tail's strong, undulating movement, a river otter propels itself through the water as fast as 8 miles (13 kilometers) per hour and can easily dive to 36 feet (11 meters) or more. Amphibious, muscular river otters swim gracefully and quickly underwater to catch prey, and they can run on land. [52], During the winter and spring, when the water levels were higher, North American river otters had a greater tendency to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. They become much more nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. [20] It differs from the European otter by its longer neck, narrower visage, the smaller space between the ears and its shorter tail. In all habitats, their basic social group is the family, consisting of an adult female and her progeny. For years, river otters have been hunted for their fur, and their pelts are still an important source of income for many people in Canada. [33] Every study done on the food habits of the North American river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. What is clear is that there is a delayed implantation of nine to 11 months, with actual gestation taking about 60 days. [41] Their dense, short under-fur is overlain by darker, coarse guard hairs that help repel water. [26], North American river otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, alternate hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or body and tail dorsoventral undulation. Sea otters weigh more -- around 45-90 pounds -- with large, furry faces. North American river otters dry themselves and uphold the insulative quality of their fur by frequent rubbing and rolling on grass, bare ground, and logs. [34] Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). The North American river otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. Check back for more information. Daily movements of yearling males and females in Idaho averaged 4.7 and 2.4 km (2.9 and 1.5 mi) in spring, 5.1 and 4.0 km (3.2 and 2.5 mi) in summer, and 5.0 and 3.3 km (3.1 and 2.1 mi) in autumn, respectively. Description: A medium-sized, elongated mammal with a cylindrical body; a broad, flattened head with a prominent nose pad and whiskers; and a long, heavy tail that is fully furred and tapers from a broad base to a point. [15] Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Home ranges of North American river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Several North American river otters may even cooperate while fishing. A clinal reduction in size may exist from north to south along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west. Small fish are eaten at the surface, but larger ones are taken to the shore to be consumed. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. The oldest living river otter on record was 27 years old. These otters are frequently observed playing and sliding together. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females of the same age. [15], Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost exclusively to permanent watersheds. Copulation lasts from 16 to 73 minutes and may occur in water or on land. [34] However, many other studies did not report any findings of North American beaver remains in the scat sampled. The North American river otters may leave the den by eight weeks and are capable of sustaining themselves upon the arrival of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the following spring. [47] In Canada, North American river otters occupy all provinces and territories, except for Prince Edward Island. Otters are playful creatures, frequently seen sliding down riverbanks or burrowing through snow. The North American river otter is the most abundant otter species, but surprisingly little is known about its life in the wild. North American river otters are very susceptible to the effects of environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). NAMA has 78 affiliated clubs and 2000 amateur mycologist members. This is a complete list of mycological societies in North America. Fur of senescent river otters may become white-tipped, and rare albinos may occur. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. White man came to the Salmon River in the very early 1800's following Lewis and Clark's 1805 expedition. ); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp. The North American river otter is found throughout North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. [15] In the wild, they normally live about 8 to 9 years,[22] but are capable of living up to 13 years of age. Today, accidental trappings in beaver traps constitute the most otter fatalities. We hope you will join us in this important work. [30][38] North American river otters do not generally handle prey of a large size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a North American river otter) are hibernating. The North American River Otter is one of only two known otter species to have delayed implantation (the other is the Sea Otter). Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island. [14] The earliest known fossil of Lontra canadensis, found in the US Midwest, is from the Irvingtonian stage (1,800,000 to 300,000 years ago). Above, an American river otter swims at the Virginia Living Museum in Newport News, Va., on Dec. 30, 2018. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water. River otters can be found in the freshwater areas of the preserve especially in the cypress swamp. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. [29] In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. [15] Females usually do not reproduce until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. In Idaho, North American river otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. Musk from the scent glands may also be secreted when otters are frightened or angry. The playful North American river otter is equally at home in the water and on land.
