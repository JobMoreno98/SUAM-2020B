Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cellulitis has a non specific pattern similar to that of soft tissue edema, it may show thickened skin with subcutaneous fat reticulations and elicit intermediate signal intensity on T1weighted images (T1WIs) and high signal intensity on T2 weighted (T2WIs) or short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images, often the affected area has a poorly defined margins however, … 3 irregular lobular mass with slight subcutaneous edema above massconcern for soft tissue sarcoma..possibly synovial cell. what exactly does this mean?
