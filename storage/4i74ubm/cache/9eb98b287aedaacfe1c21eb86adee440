A complex fibroadenoma has sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcifications, or papillary apocrine changes, and is greater than 3 mm in size. They fall under the broad group of adenomatous breast lesions. Fibroadenomas that consist of cysts greater than 3 mm, sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcifications, and/or papillary apocrine metaplasia are considered as complex fibroadenoma.

Complex fibroadenomas are said to be smaller and more commonly seen in older women than simple fibroadenomas. Fibroadenomas (FAs) of the breast are a group of benign biphasic neoplasms consisting of a proliferation of both epithelial and stromal components.1 After the seminal publication by Lim et al,2 describing mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) exon 2 mutations in approximately 60% of FAs, our group and others have not only confirmed the presence of these mutations in FAs, but also . Incidence and management of complex fibroadenomas. The mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) gene is the most common gene involved in the pathogenesis of fibroadenoma. Complex fibroadenomas are a subtype of fibroadenoma harboring one or more complex features, including epithelial calcifications, papillary apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis, and cysts larger than 3 mm [].Their incidence and clinical relevance is not clear. 1 They account for 68% of all breast masses and a large proportion of breast biopsies. These women have a slightly increased risk of subsequent breast cancer, particularly if their tumors have complex histologic patterns. i had a biopsy 2 weeks ago diagnosis was fibroadenoma, was told it had not cancer related and quited common. Giant or juvenile fibroadenoma Occasionally, a fibroadenoma can grow to more Fibroadenomas are common benign (non-cancerous) breast tumors made up of both glandular tissue and stromal (connective) tissue. Complex fibroadenomas differ from simple fibroadenomas because of the presence of cysts (3 mm), sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcifications, or papillary apocrine changes. Your doctor inserts a thin, wand-like device (cryoprobe) through your skin to the fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are associated with a slightly increased risk of carcinoma, with a somewhat higher risk if so-called &quot;complex&quot; features are present. The median age at presentation for fibroadenomas is about 25 yrs. Fibroadenoma (FA) is the most common breast tumor seen in adolescent and young women.1 Calcification and hyalinization in FA in the younger women and in reproductive age group is very rare. A benign gland has two cell layers - myoepithelial and epithelial. Fibroadenomas are most common in women in their 20s and 30s, but they can be found in women of any age. Complex fibroadenoma in some atypical cases, fibroadenomas can show internal epithelial proliferative changes that lie within the spectrum of fibrocystic change. Tumors &gt;500 g or disproportionally large compared to rest of breast. Giant fibroadenomas are fibroadenomas weighing more than 500 grams or measuring &gt;5 cm in size 2. We present a rare case of a 39 years old female with invasive ductal carcinoma arising within fibroadenoma.
