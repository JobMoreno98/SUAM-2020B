It measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time. For example, a gigabit Ethernet connection has a bandwidth of 1,000 Mbps, (125 megabytes per second). An Internet connection via cable modem may provide 25 Mbps of bandwidth. Like Servers, Printers, VOIP Phones, Backup Devices, and streaming devices. A 10Base2, or thin Ethernet, network uses thin 3/16-inch coaxial cable (with 50-ohm) impedance for the network backbone. This is actually pretty fast, but wired Ethernet connections with Cat6 cables can offer up to 10 Gb/s. Reduced Interference. Higher frequencies require more twists in the cable pairs, and that process is more expensive. The primary use of Cat 5 cables lies in structured cabling for computer networks like Ethernet over twisted pair. An Ethernet crossover cable connects two computers directly through the Ethernet ports, allowing the computers to pass or share data without having to build a network. From this article you will know the 6 advantages and disadvantages of LAN network. Ethernet advantages. For a cable internet or internet with the use of cable lines to work, there is a need of a cable modem. A computer network is a group of two or more interconnected computer systems. So the advantage of an Ethernet crossover cable is that itâs not a standard cable, and that it allows making ânon-standardâ Ethernet connections between old devices, like connecting two PCs to each other directly without a switch. There are three types of ethernet cables: coaxial, twisted pair, and fiber-optic cabling. It also provides a high level of security from any third-party access and hacking.
