View Notes - rtl_rev from ECON 101 at Acadia University. As I recall studying the original 8086 register specs is that there were four 16-bit registers designated A, B, C, and D. Then the registers could handle 8-bit data by breaking each of the registers into the &quot;high&quot; byte a. A kind of hardware description language (HDL) used in describing the registers of a computer or digital electronic system, and the way in which data is transferred between them. Bus b. A register transfer language is a type of Hardware Description Language (HDL) Since a CPU is a synchronous sequential circuit, microoperations occur at regular intervals when triggered by the clock pulse. They differ in the size, as an internal register has a larger size than that of the user-accessible register. The symbolic notation used to describe the micro-operation transfers amongst registers is called Register transfer language. It indicates a transfer of the content of register R1 into register R2. These data transfer can be represented by standard notations given below: Relying on the fact that register 0 always contains 0000, we can use the addition instruction to sum up R0 and R1 and put the result in R2. 3.3 Rules and notes.

Register transfer level is a level of description of a digital design in which the clocked behavior of the design is expressly described in terms of data transfers . Register Transfer Language Description MIPS Assembly Language Type of Instruction Common MIPS Instructions (and psuedo-instructions) A simple MIPS assembly language program to sum the elements in an array A is given below:.data array: .word 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60 length: .word 7 sum: .word 0 # Algorithm being implemented to sum an array It is constructed with the help of four 4 * 1 Multiplexers each having four data inputs (0 through 3) and two selection inputs (S1 and S2). By controlling the data i/ps to the adder, it is possible to obtain different types of arithmetic operations. A register transfer language is useful not only for describing the internal organization of a digital system but also for specifying the logic circuits needed for its design. Memory Address Registers (MAR): It holds the address of the location to be accessed from memory. Taken in turn, how each of the basic registers are used throughout the fetch-execute cycle. 2. 3. RTL means Register Transfer Language. Almost every commercial computer has its own particular ———- language 3GL. The contents of Register transfer language: Register Transfer language syntax will contain the micro operations along with the source and target registers on which the data modification will be performed with a set of control signals. The description of LBU is given in the MIPS reference manual using a register-transfer language as mem d LoadMemory(…) byte d VirtualAddress1..0 if CONDITION then GPR[rt] d 024}mem31 - 8 * byte .. 24 - 8 * byte else GPR[rt] d 024}mem7 + 8 * byte .. 8 * byte endif12.28 where byte refers to the two low-order bits of the effective address . Random transfer language b. The Register Transfer Language is the symbolic representation of notations used to specify the sequence of micro-operations.
