The base pitch is equal to the circumference of the base circle divided by the number of teeth. Gear Ratio . (f) Tooth thickness: The tooth thickness tis simply half of the tooth spacing; where the tooth spacing is the circular pitch p, so t= p 2 = ˇ 8 = 0:3927 in (16) (g) Base circle radii: The base circle is the circle from which the involute tooth pro le is generated, and can be larger or smaller than the dedendum circle. Share this post. T is the number of teeth in the gear. What is tooth thickness? CIRCULAR PITCH (p) is the distance along the pitch circle or pitch line between corresponding profiles of adjacent teeth. If the teeth are not machined by tooth cutters, and the teeth profiles are still kept intact, then the 2 gears will get jammed in transmission.
