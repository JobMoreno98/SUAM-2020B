Spoke sites are connected to each other via Hub site. As the name suggests, it is a dedicated high-speed network particularly used for data storage. this will affect data transfer from connected devices to the web. Local Area Network, Wide Area Network, Campus Area Network, and Home Area Network. Wide Area Network is also known as Wide Area Network or Wide Area Linkage. A SAN connection uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are assigned by TCP/IP to each SAN network interface controller (NIC), to determine data routing. While there are significant management and data security benefits to SAN, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution, especially when cheaper software-based alternatives may be found. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) – MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that of a LAN and smaller area as compared to WAN. A campus network is usually set in the campus of a university, but the same kind of planning and design can be applied for other purposes. Disadvantages of Installing a School Network Expensive to Install. High Setup Cost: The initial setup costs of installing Local Area Networks is high because there is special software required to make a server. World Wide Web. Infrared signal travel only in a straight line. The network requires hardware, software which demands high initial setup costs. In a Hub-and-spoke Site-to-Site Wide Area Network (WAN) network topology, one physical site act as Hub (Example, Main Office), while other physical sites act as spokes. Below are some of the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. Disadvantages of wireless local area network (WLAN) : WLAN requires license. Local area network helps to connect CCTV cameras in a building. In this system, the storage devices are not directly connected to the servers.
