Trout is certainly the Best Player of this generation and we&#x27;re lucky to see this great player. The neglecting of aspects of running the organization are starting to become very apparent and I think it is starting to add up. Both Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon are on the mend. It&#x27;s the same as it always was in Anaheim this year. The Angels now have control of Ohtani for at least six years, while . Trout generally hasn&#x27;t had the benefit of a good pitching staff, either. Mike Trout is possibly done for the year. Ohtani has 42 HR and he&#x27;s a top pitcher. The Angels have already reached one low-level contract extension with Ohtani; a two-year/$8.5MM pact that covered his first two years of arbitration eligibility.
