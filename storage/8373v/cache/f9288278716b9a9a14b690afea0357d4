Male and female Weddell seals are generally about the same length, though females can be slightly larger. [16] A sedentary adult eats around 10 kg (22 lb) a day, while an active adult eats over 50 kg (110 lb) a day. Weddell seals are highly vocal and their underwater calls are normally quite audible to a listener on the surface of the ice. [1] However, the disturbance effects of the increasing seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic on Weddell seal behavior, distribution, and foraging are still unknown. Sound waves can be transmitted either through the ice itself or from water to breathing holes where female Weddell seals are usually breeding. The Weddell seal[2] (Leptonychotes weddellii) is a relatively large and abundant true seal (family: Phocidae) with a circumpolar distribution surrounding Antarctica. These animals are thriving, classified as an animal of “least concern” with an increasing population. They form lengthy shallow dives in search of new food sources. The hairs allow the seals to detect the wake of swimming fish and use that to capture prey. Because of their widespread distribution, population assessments are difficult and expensive to conduct, and are therefore infrequently undertaken. [32] The fact that some populations breed on land (e.g., at South Georgia), could demonstrate an ability in the species to colonize different environments, although the extent of such plasticity is uncertain.[1]. Average Length: 2,9m - 9.5 ft males / females up to 3.3m - 11ft. However, weddell seal is the only species from the Antarctic tribe as well as its genus. Male and female Weddell seals communicate through a variety of sounds, specifically males sometimes use “trills” to communicate. All maps, graphics, flags, photos and original descriptions © 2021 worldatlas.com, Weddell Seal Facts: Animals of Antarctica. Weddell seal pups gain almost two kilos a day In 2000 and 2001, Norweigian scientists wanted to kill twenty Weddell seals and sixty other breeds of seal but was later luckily canceled People say sometimes that if Weddells are under water you can here them from above the ice! They eat an array of fish, bottom-feeding prawns, cephalopods and crustaceans. However, male seals tend to have a broader head and a thicker neck compared to females. [27]  Weddell Seals do not migrate in winter. Baby Weddell Seals Have the Most Adult-Like Brains in the Animal Kingdom The newborn seal pups possess the most well-developed brains compared to other mammals, but that advantage comes with a cost. Breeding season begins in the more northern habitats in Weddell Sea covers an area of approximately 2.8 million square kilometers. The Weddell Sea is 1,200 miles across at its widest point. Weddell seals dive to forage for food, maintain breathing holes in fast ice, and explore to find more ice holes. These seals are the most Southern living seals and enjoy the cold water and the amount of food they eat down there to be plentiful.The main predator of … They are opportunistic feeders that hunt in different parts of the water column depending on prey availability. These animals are known to be docile and placid, and can be approached easily. Weddell Seals are placid animals that have a body length between 2.5 and 2.9 m (8.25 - 9.5 ft) and they weigh between 400 and 600 Kgs (880 - 1,320 lbs). However, during the Antarctic winter darkness, when there is no light under the ice where the seals forage, they rely on other senses, primarily the sense of touch from their vibrissae or whiskers, which are not just hairs, but very complicated sense organs with more than 500 nerve endings that attach to the animal's snout. Mother Weddell seals use vocalizations to call their pups from further distances when smell can no longer be used efficiently (Opzeeland et al., 2011). Weddell seals on ice are able to hear the calls of Weddell seals in the water as long as noise level on land is low and they are in close proximity of one another. Weddell seals are top predators in the Antarctic. Males weigh less than females, usually about 500 kg (1,100 lb) or less. Weddell seal, (Leptonychotes weddellii), nonmigratory earless seal (family Phocidae) found around the South Pole, on or near the coast of Antarctica.The Weddell seal is a rotund animal that grows to about 3 metres (10 feet) in length and about 400 kg (880 pounds) in weight; the female is larger than the male. Their calls can be heard from atop the ice even when seals themselves are below. It is one of the four species of Antarctic seals, collectively known as lobodontine seals. There are recordings of four different penguin species being attacked by Weddell seals: gentoo penguins, an emperor penguin, an Adélie penguin, and a chinstrap penguin. If you had to choose only one word to describe the Weddell Seal, it would like be that they are cute. Individual Weddell seals can each produce their own unique song, but singing behavior is not common when observed. Produced by Jeremy Schmidt of the Erebus Bay Weddell seal population study. Weddell seals are large animals. Weddell Seals are an example of ‘True Seal’ and are native to Antractica. It has not been confirmed, however, if the penguins were consumed after being killed. [8] This coat moults around the beginning of summer. [9] Weddell seals undergo delayed implantation. They can be easily approached without much stress to the animal. [1] This species is not listed by CITES. [19] Interesting Facts about Weddell Seal The Weddell Seal lives in the Antarctic region mainly on the Antarctic ice. Maximum lifespan of the species is estimated at least 25 years. During their mating season, Weddell seals make noise loud enough to pass through ice. [14] After dropping away from a breathing hole in the ice, the seals become negatively buoyant in the first 30 to 50 m, allowing them to dive with little effort. Weddell seals are also able to communicate to each other through different mediums. Generally, they … Scientifically named Leptonychotes weddellii after their discoverer, the British seal hunter and explorer James Weddell, the weddell seal is a relatively large and abundant seal in the Phocidae family of “true seals”, within the Class Mammalia and the order Carnivora. common seal), otaridae, eared seals (eg. Seals are fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. [10] The Weddell seal face has been compared to that of a cat due to a short mouth line and similarities in the structure of the nose and whiskers. The best available estimate suggests that the species greatly exceeds 1,000,000 individuals, which was considered the upper limit from previous estimations [30] although there is large uncertainty in these figures. 6 Wonderful Weddell Seal Facts Weddell Seals live the furthest south of any mammals. The color of the pups are golden or silver but their parents are usually grey. [3] The life history of this species is well documented since it occupies fast ice environments close to the Antarctic continent and often adjacent to Antarctic bases. Weddell Seal Facts Why are they called Weddell seals? Weddell seals are carnivores. [20] Weddell seal populations will often return to the same breeding sites over consecutive breeding seasons. Cephalopods are common prey, and crustacean remains are sometimes found in Weddell seal scat, but at much lower rates than other prey species. The head is small relative to body size and the colour is usually dappled grey and black on the back with a mostly white under-belly. In the past, the establishment of Antarctic research bases has caused a measure of disturbance to these seals. Since Weddell Seals are the most studied of any Seal species in the Antarctic. Since the Weddell Sea is well within the Antarctic climatic zone, its fauna is that typical of other Antarctic regions—penguins, Weddell seals, petrels, and the like. The Weddell seal has a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica, preferring land-fast ice habitats, but the proximity to open water and pack ice also influences the distribution of haul-out sites in fast-ice areas. [23] Additionally, fast ice breeding grounds causes females to cluster in large aggregations, making it easier for males to take control over his own harem. They also eat some cephalopods and crustaceans. [12] Weddell seals usually give birth to one pup per year,[12] however the Weddell seal is one of the only species of seals that can give birth to twin pups. Copulation occurs mainly under water. The Weddell seal was discovered and named in the 1820s during expeditions led by British sealing captain James Weddell to the area of the Southern Ocean now known as the Weddell Sea. Weddell seal is a relatively large seal. [8] Antarctic cod and silverfish constitute the majority of their diet. Currently there are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Populations have since recovered after the elimination of commercial sealing in the 1980s. fur seals and sea lions) and odobenidae (walrus). [11] In the winter, they stay in the water to avoid blizzards, with only their heads poking through breathing holes in the ice. Males weigh less than females, usually about 500 kg (1,100 lb) or less. During the early periods of Antarctic exploration, Weddell seals suffered dramatic declines as they were hunted for food and oil. feeds mainly on squid and fish. Weddell seals hunt in both pelagic and benthic-demersal habitats. This very short video presents five fascinating facts about Antarctica's iconic Weddell seals. The mouth of the leopard seal turns upward at the edges, resembling a smile. Leopard seals live in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters of the Ross Sea, Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, South Georgia, and Falkland Islands. It is believed that Weddell seals rely mainly on eyesight and light to hunt for food. [21] Depending on the latitude it inhabits, this marine mammal gives birth from early September through November, with those living at lower latitudes giving birth earlier. Leopard seals do not play well with others! They are silver/grey in colour and they have short dense fur that protects them from water temperatures as low as -2°C (28°F). Pups also use higher, more urgent vocalizations when hungry to alert their mothers to feed.[28]. They live in packs and when underwater remain close to their breeding colonies. [31]  Climate changes affecting the duration and the extent of the sea ice and nutrients availability could potentially reduce pups’ survival and may have important implications for population growth rates. [9], The Weddell seal grows a thin fur coat around its whole body except for small areas around the flippers. Breeding Season: Pups born from September to November, females become pregnant again very quickly as the males guard territories around breathing holes, there is an implantation delay of 2 months and then the female is pregnant for 11 months, typically 2 pups are … [3] Males defend underwater territories during the breeding season and have been observed to fight. Weddell seals are the second most abundant species of Antarctic phocid, after the crabeater seal. 5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_behavior_of_Weddell_seals [15] Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) is the most southern mammal in the world. Males generally guard territories around breathing holes. There are 33 species of seals found throughout the world. With a face resembling a smiling cat and an endearingly placid and docile disposition on the ice, the Weddell seal is a [17] While females can grow up to 10.8 feet (3.3 meters), males typically only grow to 9.5 feet (2.9 meters). There have been recordings of Weddell seal vocalizations that are described as songs. The other three seals from this tribe are Ross seal, leopard seal and crabeater seal. Peter Johnson/Corbis/VCG / Getty Images Habitat and Distribution . A sedentary adult can eat about 22 lbs (10 kg) a day, while an active adult eats over 110 lbs (50 kg) daily. Weddell seals are the most Southern breeding mammals of the Earth.

[25] The seals are normally around six to eight years old when they first breed, but this can be much earlier for some females. Weddell seal pups are born with a lanugo of similar coloration and they moult after 3–4 weeks; later, they turn a darker color similar to that of adults. They prefer to travel in packs and, when not migrating in search of food, they mostly sleep. Their songs consist of repetitive sequences of the same vocal elements, and they only vary slightly over time. Female Weddell seals reach sexual maturity between 3-6 years, males between 7-8 years. Being versatile feeders, the main food for the Weddell seal is fish, such as the Antarctic cod and Antarctic silverfish. [26]  They have been seen blowing air bubbles into cracks under the sea ice to flush out prey. They have occasional migrations of several hundred miles, especially when young adults. Weddell Seals are a type of Seal.It's exclusive to Weddell.It commonly lives in a island called Seal Island. Females are generally larger than males. Weddell Seals live under the ice during winter and chew holes in the ice to get to the air. The colour and pattern of the coat varies, often fading to a duller colour as the seal ages. Adult Weddell seals have a dark gray coat that is marked with black and lighter gray areas. Weddell seals live to be about 30 years old and are mature adults between three and seven years of age. Vocalizations are also important in mother-pup Weddell seal interactions. [12] The species is primarily restricted to Antarctic waters: physical factors, such as glacial movement and tidal action, may increase fluctuations in distributions. [12] The pups take their first swim around one to two weeks of age. [7] Males weigh less than females, usually about 500 kg (1,100 lb) or less. [18] They are actually known as the southern-most mammals in the world. Weddell seals are commonly found on fast ice, or ice fastened to land, and gather in small groups around cracks and holes within the ice. These threatening neighbors prey primarily on pups and juveniles, as they are easier to attain. The Weddell seal is one of the only types of seal that can have twin pups. It is classified as being of "least concern" by the IUCN. Traveling to Antarctica in November means being able to experience Weddell Seals (as well as Southern elephant seals) emerge onto sea ice to molt and bask under the Austral skies. Their weights vary with seasons and at different stages of production, their weight range varies from 881 to 1,102 pounds (400-500 kilograms). They were named for Sir James Weddell, a British sealing captain in the 1820s. When they dive, they prefer to remain close to their access holes on top of the ice. The female is often bitten on the neck by her partner if she tries to escape or terminate copulation. They can remain in the same spot for hours while sleeping, causing them to eventually melt a hollow ice hole underneath them. In January 1998 the Environmental Protection Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty was ratified, implementing environmental measures such as the banning of mining and oil drilling in Antarctica for at least 50 years, along with the banning of refuse disposal and the use of pesticides in the region. [13] They have been observed to dive as deep as 600 m for up to an hour. Well-known for being excellent divers, Weddell seals can stay under water for as long as 80 minutes. The females tend to be a bit larger than the males. [9] A molecular genetic based technique has been established to confirm the sex of individuals in the laboratory. When searching for prey, Weddell seals can dive under water for about 45 minutes and reach depths of up to 787 yards (720 meters). The mating season occurs during austral spring between late November and December after pups are weaned and females begin ovulating. Weddell seals measure about 2.5–3.5 m (8 ft 2 in–11 ft 6 in) long and weigh 400–600 kg (880–1,320 lb). Weddell Seal Facts: Animals of Antarctica Weddell Seals are highly social animals. Both adult males and females are about 3 metres long and weigh around 400–500kg. Although seabirds are not usually part of their diet, there have been several sightings of them chasing and killing penguins in the wild.  [5][6] They are amongst the largest seals, with a rather bulky body and short fore flippers relative to their body length. The average lifespan of Weddell seals is close to thirty years. Weddell Seal facts - Basics. One interesting behavioral trait is regarding their sleeping and resting habits. These aquatic animals have the most southerly distribution of any mammal. Weddell Seals are credited as the lifeguards of Weddell.All Weddell Seals are part of the United States of Antarctica Coast Guards, where they serve in the Weddell Coast Guard.It's there job to keep Weddell's waters and islands safe. Weddell seals are non-migratory phocids that move regionally to follow the distribution of breathing holes and exit cracks within the ice changes between seasons. The pups are around half the length of their mother at birth, and weigh 25–30 kg (55–66 lb). They are exceptionally solitary animals. Common name: Weddell seal Scientific name: Leptonychotes weddelliiWhere do they live? Weddell seals are undeniably animals of the ice, tending to stay around “fast ice”, which is sea ice attached to the shore connecting two icebergs.
