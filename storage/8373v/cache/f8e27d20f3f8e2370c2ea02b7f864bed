Let’s clarify a bit K8S versioning, according official documentation Kubernetes versions are expressed as x.y.z, where x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is the patch version. Ensure that any PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) allow for at least 1 pod replica to be moved at a time otherwise the drain/evict operation will fail. An AKS cluster upgrade triggers a cordon and drain of your nodes. From here I will do a step-by-step Upgrade of a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Cluster to a newer version and set Azure Monitor alert rule active for the future to get an Alert notification when a colleague is upgrading the AKS Services. For example: 1. AKS Supported Versions. To speed up the node image upgrade process, you can upgrade your node images using a customizable node surge value. You learn how to: Valid Azure Account: A valid service account that allows you to use sufficient resource quota. Skipping MINOR versions when upgrading is unsupported. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version 1.12.5. az aks upgrade –resource-group myResourceGroup –name myAKSCluster –kubernetes-version 1.12.5. United States (English) The current node image is shown in the nodeImageVersion property. If you'd like to increase the speed of upgrades, use the --max-surge value to configure the number of nodes to be used for upgrades so they complete faster. Navigate to the Suite Installer Dashboard (see Prepare Infrastructure). az aks show --resource-group RGNAME --name CLUSTENAME --output table. During the upgrade process, AKS will: It takes a few minutes to upgrade the cluster, depending on how many nodes you have. When the old node is fully drained, it will be reimaged to receive the new version and it will become the buffer node for the following node to be upgraded. Kubernetes Version Upgrade on AKS We will start from Kubernetes orchestrators version upgrade. Upgrade Azure AKS kubernetes control and agents to the latest version First a word of caution. If you are on the n-3version, you are outside of support and will be asked to upgrade.

What happens when a customer upgrades a Kubernetes cluster with a minor version that is not supported? For more information about the latest images provided by AKS, see the AKS release notes. The official and supported way is the AKS cluster upgrade to the latest offered Kubernetes version in Azure. For production node pools, we recommend a max-surge setting of 33%. If the max surge value is lower than the current node count at the time of upgrade, the current node count is used for the max surge value. Node image upgrade enables you to update node-level components such as the container runtime or OS updates without going through a full Kubernetes upgrade. AKS will be retiring v1.13 on 27 February 2020. After confirming the operation, you can grep another cup of ☕️ and wait for the upgrade process to finish.

We detected that one or more AKS clusters for the Subscription ID (s) listed in the Account Information section are using Kubernetes v1.13 or lower. An integer such as "5" indicates five additional nodes to surge. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. If you have a low compute quota available, the upgrade may fail. Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones.

On Monday, December 9, 2019 (2019-12-09), we’re removing support for Kubernetes versions older than the latest version (N), and two minor versions prior (N-2), because support for Kubernetes 1.15 will become available on that date. As Kubernetes Upstream approaches that milestone, the Kubernetes community will be working to document viable alternatives. For example, a max surge value of 100% provides the fastest possible upgrade process (doubling the node count) but also causes all nodes in the node pool to be drained simultaneously. Here you see all the newer versions of Kubernetes.
