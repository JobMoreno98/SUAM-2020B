It tells the story of an upper-class family in the months leading up to the Second World War - sort of like Brideshead Revisited, but with more politics. I asked myself whether better editing would have made enough difference to not regret wanting those couple hours back that I wasted watching this. 1939 is set between present-day London and the idyllic British countryside in the time before the beginning of the Second World War. I can only suppose that all those years writing for the BBC led Poliakoff to believe that incinerating pussy cats would be a good metaphor for the Holocaust. I enjoyed the film but there were definitely a few situations that did not ring true. It tells the story of the aristocratic Keyes family in the days leading up to the outbreak of WWII. Poliakoff is the Rembrandt of contemporary British filmed drama, who paints the light magically and miraculously with a uniquely dark and Manichean brush. Britain in the 20th century produced traitors of all kinds at such a rate that there was simply no way of keeping track of them all, and few of them have ever been publicly acknowledged. Find where to watch Glorious 39 in New Zealand. David Tennant .     |                         These two come together in 'Glorious 39', which one may describe as a '39 Steps' kind of thriller; and in its middle portion, it's briefly gripping, albeit in a style that seems a deliberate pastiche of an earlier style of film. Glorious 39 (2009) Cast.                         | Rating: 2/5                         |, October 28, 2019 A ripping, old-school conspiracy thriller.                               Coming Soon, Regal I am a big fan of Poliakoff and this should have been great atmospheric piece but important parts are just off key, most of all the script that seem couple of drafts away from being what it could have been. The percentage of users who rated this 3.5 stars or higher. Listening to the cast talk about the history, it sounded like they believed that no-one had ever heard about the lengths appeasement might have gone to in England. And for a thriller feature film with real depth and meaning, how much further can anyone go than this one? You: "How on earth I killed all that crap you just pulled is beyond me. Despite a few convincing turns, the feature is disappointingly winded, eventually going off on a few needless tangents that derail the whole production. There are lines of incongruous or anachronistic dialogue, and much of the acting is exceedingly flat. This 10-digit number is your confirmation number. Glorious 39 (DVD) : In this tense WWII-era thriller, Anne, a young woman from a political family, stumbles upon sinister evidence relating to a secret Nazi conspiracy plot and ends up …                      I recommend this but again, it's not for everyone, and you need to be in the mood to watch a movie like this one. This is another fine example of film-making and although it's not up to the standards of 'Close My Eyes', 'Friends and Crocodiles' and 'Capturing Mary' it is still a gripping thriller with a sense of dread pervading the whole thing. We are not surprised this was a flop and ended up in the bargain bin. Basically in present day London, Michael Walton (Toby Regbo) is meeting his older cousins Walter Page (Christopher Lee) and Oliver (Corin Redgrave) to find out more about the sister of his grandmother Celia Keyes (Juno Temple), his great aunt Anne Keyes (Romola Garai). Awards Enter a sinister character played by Jeremy Northam, soon to be followed by the suicide(?) We won’t be able to verify your ticket today, but it’s great to know for the future. Glorious 39. It has received poor reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 6.4. as Hector. A mysterious tale set around a traditional British family on the eve of World War Two. A mystery surrounds a British family on the eve of World War II. Before any questions can be answered, a song on the radio transports them all back to a summer evening in 1939 where Anne's father Alexander(Bill Nighy), a respected politician, holds court while Hector(David Tennant) hectors everybody about the state of Nazi Germany. Of course, when they are done well. The story is a little complicated, because you are not sure if she is going mad, and why it has happening to her, but she is seen alive and elderly by the end of the film in present day. That's not to mention the attention to detail, although one has to wonder if they had the technology to surreptitiously record conversations back then. Pro-Nazi supporters among the British upper classes are a well known fact, but that part of history deserves serious handling.                         romance,                                       Just tighter editing might have helped at times, like when the first record (oh so conveniently) got broken. There were good performances by Julie Christie as a batty aunt and Jeremy Northam as a sinister government official. Just remember that nothing is as ever simple as it first seems, nor was 'appeasement,' as Noam Chomsky points out elsewhere that England in 1938 was more worried about the threat posed by the Soviet Union than Nazi Germany. The plot is incoherent and hackneyed: the good guys all want to fight the Nazis, the nasty people don't; even the use of an adopted child as the lead character seems to be a cheap way of having a cake and eating it, as it allows the director to revel in the aristocratic excess while simultaneously suggesting there was something terrible about it. It starts off with an impassioned speech about all the reasons that Hitler is on the verge of taking over Europe and why Churchill should be the true leader of the UK. Unfortunately may parts of the story seemed to weird to be true and in the end I didn't understand if the girl was simply crazy. Then the characters, randomly walking around, tattling some nonsensical lines, and not a one of them looks real. Glorious 39 Share DVD • November 20, 2009 • 2h 9m • R • Budget $6M One of the weakest parts of this film was that it began (and ended) with a rather pointless visit to the future, introducing a young descendant of the family in the main plot, who is apparently investigating their family history. Glorious 39 is a 2009 Stephen Poliakoff film, starring a ridiculous number of high-profile actors, such as Romola Garai, Bill Nighy and David Tennant. However it is not clever or shocking or original or suspenseful.                         |, November 20, 2009 Just leave us a message here and we will work on getting you verified. It's finally happening! All you did was stand in crap on ground and die" *You identify templar relic you just found.  Few British people would NOT know this, given that their abdicated king Edward and his wife Wallis Simpson openly admired Hitler, and many other high-borns found him quite right to attack democracy in its heart.     |                         This film had an excellent opportunity to be an engaging commentary on England before World War II.                      Título original: Glorious 39. I first came across the captivating young British actress Romola Garai in the 2004 movie "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights".                      This film is set in 1939 in Britain, and what it reveals is one of the most terrifying of all the untold stories in which the true and secret history of Britain abounds. Small roles by Toby Regbo, Christopher Lee, Corin Redgrave and others make this a cast rich in some of the finest British actors of the day. She doesn't seem clever enough to figure out the film's plot, and the moments when the film forces her to "be suspenseful" fail because she doesn't seem to raise the stakes of her performance. I give it a B-. There were some MPs who were anti-appeasement, but their lives were not exactly made easy.                      Glorious 39 is a ripping, old-school conspiracy thriller, played out in the fraught run-up to the second world war. Just plain old-fashioned duff. Glorious 39 was quite simply, awful. I happen to be a big fan of British period dramas. It kept me watching but my mind did wander a bit. The child acting is also exceedingly wooden. We are taken by flashback to 1939 where Anne is an actress in the beautiful British countryside, and this is at the time when the World War II was beginning. It is interesting that one of the victims of the British Vehme shown in the film is someone we see hanging upside down in a sack. The '39' refers to 1939 when Britain was on the edge of war with Germany. Glorious 39 is an War, Drama, History, Thriller movie that was released in 2009 and has a run time of 1 hr 48 min. Regal You really feel for Anne and the way her life begins to fall apart. Cinemark                         mystery and thriller, BBC Films,                       Featured Felines: The prestigious Keyes family lives between a … Action Drama History Thriller War.                         war,  The Home Office had in proportion fewer communists but more fascists than the Foreign Office. Anyone who had watched one documentary on Edward VIII seemed to be more au fait with the facts than the purveyors here.                         |, November 20, 2009 I will admit first that I didn't understand the full story by about halfway through, but the performances by the all British cast, especially Garai, are very good, and there are some memorable moments, so it is certainly not a bad wartime drama. Oblivious to the looming shadow of World War II, the wealthy Keyes maintain a confident façade in the British countryside until daughter Anne becomes an unexpected pawn. Just why the anonymity of the fascist traitors is still being protected today is something of a puzzle. Such a disappointment. All rights reserved. In what now seems a somewhat exaggerated tidbit of praise, Company called the film "This year's Atonement". It's a shame, as for a number of years, Polliakoff's work was consistently interesting; but this is a mess. Then a Bulldog Drummond plot unfolds. Poco tiempo antes del comienzo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, una joven inglesa se encontrará, accidentalmente, con una serie de grabaciones oficiales sobre la postura de su país ante el inminente conflicto.                      Get more information about Glorious 39 (2009) on IMDb Genres & Description. In present-day London, Michael Walton (Toby Regbo) visits his cousins, Walter and Oliver Page (Christopher Lee and Corin Redgrave). This film bears all the traditional hallmarks of Poliakoff obsessions: the evocative power of the past, the magic of memory, the mystical bonds of extended family connections, the hidden energies of secrets kept buried for too long, and the shattering consequences of the revelation of truth which has been suppressed. The film had a very poor storyline, was overly dramatic, built tension so many times with so many anticlimaxes it left us feeling like we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives. Entertainment news about the biggest TV shows, films and celebrities, updated around the clock. Instead of inquiring about his grandmother, Celia(Juno Temple), he wants to know about her sister, Anne(Romola Garai), an actress who disappeared. This seemed (from an oft-repeated BBC trailer) a fascinating pre-war thriller worthy of Graham Greene or John le Carre. ...

The father played superbly by Bill Nighy is an influential MP and an all round "good egg" of a dad to his three children.                                     Not glorious. But I gotta admit it didn't make sense. Sign up here. You: "+200 intellect, if only it worked that way".                         | Rating: 3/5 A good watch if you like British mysteries. I say B-, A glorious triumph of the drama of anxiety and suspense, A poorly executed attempt at something that could have been great, Too safe and patronising to be meaningful, too leaden to be entertaining. That's too much for one post, so I divided into two. A believable screenplay was needed, better editing, a less melodramatic/cheesy score. There are no approved quotes yet for this movie. This one promised quite a lot: a great cast including Jeremy Northam, Bill Nighy and Romola Garay, a plot in the first year of the second world War, it seemed like a recipe for a great movie. Alas, this is a dreadful mess of a movie. They won't be able to see your review if you only submit your rating. Spoiler: Cliff notes for 109-110 Chapter 109: aftermath of Soveishu's confession. It is pretty, though, in terms of dresses and houses and lighting, if not the actors. Stephen Polliakoff's work has shown some consistent concerns: two of them are a nostalgic view of the aristocratic past, and an interest in the aftermath of Nazism.                                               After one of her friends who speaks out against Hitler is found dead, Anne begins to dig deeper into the reasons for his death. I viewed this via DVD in the company of family and friends, and there wasn't one of us who could say we enjoyed it. Plot: On the eve of WWII, an English aristocrat stumbles on a plot involving her family and the appeasement of Hitler. Glorious 39 starts out with a very interesting 'murder mystery.' I have just watched this film with my wife, 43, my daughters 16, & 19 and my daughter's friend (male, 20). I didn't really understand what the point of it all was..

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Vehme assassinated more than 6,000 leading members of the political opposition inside Germany, thereby so enfeebling the opposition parties that they had no effective leadership left even before the Reichstag fire which Hitler arranged as his pretext for the Enabling Act which gave him the supra-legal powers to establish his absolute dictatorship and dispense with the opposition altogether by arresting and executing their leaders with the official sanction of the state.
