Journal of Plant Physiology, 138(4):383-386, Khan, Z. R., Midega, C. A. O., Hassanali, A., Pickett, J. A detailed scanning electron microscopy study by Dorr (1997) showed that invading Striga cells perforate the host vascular system using a specialized structure, the osculum. Striga seeds require a certain time of after‐ripening, about 6 months at elevated temperatures. Weed Research (Oxford), 36(6):515-520; 22 ref. parasitism militates against increased maize production and productivity in savannas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Critical stages in the life of an obligate root parasite are as follows: (i) the identification of a suitable host, thus coupling germination and seedling growth with the presence and direction of a potential host; (ii) gain of access to the host's nutrients and water supply; this process involves the production of a functional haustorium; (iii) completion of the life cycle on the host; this includes the establishment of parasitism and its maintenance until seeds are set. Striga hermonthica and S. asiatica primarily infect cereals in the Poaceae family, while the primary hosts of S. gesnerioides are cowpea and wild legume species. and mil­ let are produced. '"-Striga is an inefficient photosyn­ thesizer. effects are more severe . Kroschel J; Hundt A; Abbasher AA; Sauerborn J, 1996. International Sorghum and Millets Newsletter, 43:57-60. (Parker, 2009). Host plant resistance is the only practical control method. Carbon isotope ratios demonstrate carbon flux from C to C parasite. Striga is an infernal Discipline associated with secret witch-cults in the Dark Ages of Europe. The parasitic weed Striga is the greatest biological constraint to production of many crops in Africa and parts of Asia. Benth. So far, there is only one report on the existence of QTL for Striga resistance on chromosome 6 of maize. Possibilities for the Biological Control of Striga Species in the Sahel. Effect of sorghum variety on Striga hermonthica parasitism and reproduction. Also the bracts in S. aspera are narrower, 1-2 mm only and without a fringe of hairs. In addition to chemical signals, a thigmotropic response is required for Striga to produce morphologically normal haustoria (Wolf and Timko, 1991). The root exudate from P. japonicum is able to induce the germination of S. hermonthica, but S. hermonthica radicals rarely penetrate to P. japonicum roots (Yoshida and Shirasu, 2009). Pest Management Science. Five virulence genotypes (races) of S. gesnerioides have been identified in different regions of Africa. A., Wadhams, L. J., Wanjoya, A., 2006. Striga, an invasive parasitic weed with purple-colored flowers, looks striking and harmless. Table 1 con­ tains a list of synonyms, the geographical range, and some hosts of Striga species. (Scrophulariaceae) and their insect natural enemies in East Africa with a discussion on the possibilities of biological control. But, beyond that mark of beauty, is a nutrient-sucking monster that stunts crops such as maize and sorghum, leaving affected farmers counting losses. After emergence from the soil, Striga plants begin to photosynthesize. This region is also the birthplace of domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), which is a major host species for several Striga species, including S. hermonthica (Delile) Benth. Striga hermonthica (Benth.) Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label. Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds, Stellenbosch, 1996. 5 (2), 157-161. 44 (3), 157-162. Overall, the authors came to the conclusion that the analysed Striga genomes have a rather typically complex angiosperm genome. At the same time, PGPR may exhibit beneficial effects on growth & C.A. Parasitic weeds of the world: biology and control. PQR database. Although Striga currently does not pose a high risk for modern high‐input agricultural systems, such as those in the south‐eastern USA, it remains a significant problem for African farmers with no or only limited access to fertilizers, herbicides and modern mechanical tillage equipment (Berner et al., 1997). Other Striga species have different coloured flowers and/or more ribs on the calyx tube (see, Dactyloctenium aegyptium (crowfoot grass), Paspalum scrobiculatum (ricegrass paspalum), http://www.eppo.int/DATABASES/pqr/pqr.htm, Press MC; Shah N; Tuohy JM; Stewart GR, 1987. It is currently unknown which Striga genes are required to successfully infect susceptible host plants. Entomophaga, 40(2):211-221; 19 ref. by Lagoke STO, Hoevers R, M'Boob SS, Traboulsi]. The incompatible interaction with S. hermonthica was characterized by higher expression of genes in the biosynthetic pathway for vestitol. Musselman LJ; Hepper FN, 1986.

Li and Timko (2009) cloned the RSG3‐301 gene and showed that it encodes a coiled‐coil nuclear‐binding site leucine‐rich repeat (CC‐NBS‐LRR) type of resistance (R) protein. Approche méthodologique de lutte integrée contre le striga: processus d'une apprentissage alternatif et participatif de recherche-action (Methodology for the integrated control of Striga: a process of alternative and participatory action-research learning). S. asiatica and S. hermonthica infect grain crops such as sorghum, millet, maize, upland rice, and sugarcane, causing $US billions of annual yield losses [ 1, 2, 3 ]. Genetic Markers Associated With Striga Gesnerioides Resistance And Seed Sizes In Cowpea [Vigna Unguiculata (L.) Walp.] (1997), this could be an adaptation to prevent germination during the last rains of the seasons, when no hosts are in the field. It is not known how Striga manipulates transcription in host plants. Sauerborn J; Abbasher AA; Kroschel J; Cornes DW; Zoschke A; Hine KT, 1996. 2012.

Pathogenicity of fungi collected in northern Ghana to Striga hermonthica. Asian S. asiatica occurs mainly in the form of two morphotypes: white‐flowered S. asiatica, which is found in India and Pakistan, and a yellow‐flowered race which is predominant in Thailand and Indonesia (Vasudcva Rao, 1984). Tanzania marks a transition zone between S. hermonthica and S. asiatica, with S. asiatica becoming more problematic in countries such as Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar (Parker, 2009). Which molecules are exchanged at the haustorium interface? Strigoi in Romanian mythology are troubled spirits that are said to have risen from the grave. Drought is the major constraint to agriculture in semi‐arid zones. Scrophulariaceae. Use the link below to share a full-text version of this article with your friends and colleagues. The radical tip grows chemotropically towards potential host roots after germination. Integrated management of Striga hermonthica in sorghum using a mycoherbicide and host plant resistance in the Nigerian Sudano-Sahelian savanna. Benth.

Ciotola M; Watson AK; Hallett SG, 1995. Bengaly M'P, Defoer T, Stoop W, Sanogo Z J L, 1998. Germination is linked to the presence of a nearby host, because the endosperm of Striga seeds can sustain growth/life only for the first 3–7 days (Berner et al., 1995). and Vicia narbonensis (L.) were observed by electron microscopy (Dorr and Kollmann, 1995). Field Crops Research. A geographical atlas of world weeds. For example, S. angustifolia (Don) Saldhana has been reported to infect sorghum, rice and sugarcane in India, and S. aspera causes significant losses on maize plantations in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia and on rice plantations in Ivory Coast and Senegal (Kroschel, 1993). For example, comparative studies on repetitive regions in five Striga species generated a total of about 2200 Sanger sequence reads and about 10 000 454 reads (Estep et al., 2012). It remains to be shown whether and to what extent RNA molecules travel between Striga and host plants and, if so, whether these molecules can function in trans. Journal d'Agriculture Traditionnelle et de Botanique Appliquee, 34:47-49. A balance between the detoxification and accumulation of the haustorium‐inducing semi‐quinone might create an equilibrium‐dependent threshold mechanism, whereby a continuous exposure to DMBQ is required for haustoria formation. Within that time, Striga must successfully establish a parasitic relationship with the host plant or otherwise die. There is not much known about the curse that turns females into striga.

It encompasses hexes and dark connections to the natural world. A survey of Striga spp. Secondary haustoria are believed to be evolutionarily older than primary or terminal haustoria (Westwood et al., 2010). Benth parasitizes maize (Zea mays L.) in sub‐Saharan Africa, causing yield losses of up to 100% under severe infestation. & Schltdl.) M'Boob SS, 1994. She is filled with hatred towards all living beings, devouring them without a second thought. Biology and management of Orobanche. Practitioners are often referred to as strigmaga, or "nightwalkers." However, the low CO2 fixation and high dark respiration rates of S. asiatica result in a negative carbon gain over the 24‐h period, thus making Striga still host dependent when growing above ground (Press et al., 1987). In: Approche méthodologique de lutte integrée contre le striga: processus d'une apprentissage alternatif et participatif de recherche-action, 56 pp. Striga hermonthica control with Fusarium nygamai in maize. & C.A. An understanding of Striga parasite biology, which could lead to agricultural solutions, has been hampered by the lack of genome information. Babiker AGT; Ahmed NE; Ejeta LG; Butler LG; Mohammed A; El Mana MT; El Tayeb SM; Abdel Rahamman BE, 1996. Roughly 80% of the described Striga species are endemic to Africa, nine species are found outside Africa and three species, S. curvilflora Benth., S. multiflora Benth. S. hermonthica causes characteristic yellowish blotches in the foliage about 1 cm long by 0.5 cm wide. Once xylem‐to‐xylem connections are established, the cotyledons of Striga enlarge and break free from the seed coat within 24 h (Hood et al., 1998). Striga asiatica infestation is less severe in Asia relative to Africa. Unlike Striga, Orobanche plants lack chlorophyll and are fleshy with scale-like leaves and less colorful flowers. In particular, S. hermonthica, S. asiatica and S. gesnerioides cause immense losses to major stable crops in sub‐Saharan Africa. There is not much known about the curse that turns females into striga. ‘Striga’ is the Latin word for ‘witch’. Chemical control of Striga hermonthica in sorghum. Major Weeds of the Near East.

Identification of Striga resistance genes is important in developing genotypes with durable resistance. Vatke is one of the most important constraints to cowpea production. Striga hermonthica flowering on a sorghum crop. Only five Striga species are currently of economic importance, with S. hermonthica causing by far the most serious damage to sub‐Saharan cereal production, followed by S. asiatica, S. gesnerioides and, to a far lesser extent, S. aspera and S. forbesi Benth. Nairobi, Kenya: Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, 16 pp. Although infection is mainly terminated in the cortex of Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen, S. hermonthica reaches the stele in Arabidopsis and cowpea, but fails to develop beyond the six‐leaf‐pair stage (Yoshida and Shirasu, 2009). Plits, 12(1):144 pp. Khan Z R, Midega C A O, Hassanali A, Pickett J A, Wadhams L J, Wanjoya A, 2006. Unlike Striga asiatica it occurs not only on light, sandy soils but also on heavy clays and even on vertisols. Tropical Plant Biology, 4(2):91-98. http://www.springerlink.com/content/q78116547587771u/, Greathead DJ, 1984. However, interspecies plasmodesmata between S. gesnerioides and pea (Dorr, 1996) raise the possibility of symplastic transport of nutrients and signalling molecules between Striga and host plants. Striga is a genus of parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae family that includes major agricultural weeds. Striga asiatica (with red flowers) is found in southern Africa while Striga hermonthica (with purple flowers) is found in east and west Africa. It also causes considerable crop losses in other regions, including other tropical and subtropical crops in its native range and in the Americas. Integrated management of Striga hermonthica, stemborers, and declining soil fertility in western Kenya. Evaluation of Fusarium semitectum var. The relative production of sorghum and cowpea in West Africa, East Africa and South‐East Asia is based on values published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, http://www.fao.org/corp/statistics/en) for 2011.

The only well-documented example of a striga's lifetime was that of Adda the White, daughter of Foltest, king of Temeria. Proceedings of the third international workshop on Orobanche and related Striga research, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 8-12 November 1993 [edited by Pieterse, A.H.; Verkleij, J.A.C. Year. Not only ABA, but also other plant hormones, such as cytokines and gibberellic acid levels, are altered in sorghum plants infected with Striga relative to control plants (Musselman, 1980; Taylor et al., 1996). They were clearly thought to cast spells to cause men to waste away; thus came the tern “owl-blasted.” As one can plainly see the above bias version of striges is from a Christian viewpoint. 1A), with a geographical distribution ranging from South Africa to East Africa and from the Arabian Peninsula to Far East Asia, including India and Pakistan (mainly on sorghum and millet), Cambodia, China, Thailand (maize in the 1970s), Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines (mainly on rice) (Musselman, 1980). Baltus PCW; Ransom JK; Odhiambo GD; Egbers WS; Borg SJ ter; Verkleij JAC; Pieterse AH, 1994. Avirulence gene products are interesting candidates, but difficult to isolate as a result of limited genetic resources in parasitic plants. The evolutionary strategy of exchanging autotrophy for dependence on host plants (parasitism) may seem odd, but it has proven to be evolutionarily successful for several plant species. Larger plants may be much branched. Transcripts associated with mitochondrial respiratory functions were over-represented in the roots of T. versicolor when connected to the host or induced by DMBQ within 5 h (Torres et al., 2005). xlix + 391 pp. Striga hermonthica is widespread in sub‐Saharan Africa, and is found throughout West Africa to Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya in East Africa (Fig. Major discoveries in biosynthesis and perception have been made in recent years, and key players have also been predicted to be present in Striga (Cardoso et al., 2011; Yoshida and Shirasu, 2012). Ideally, breeding for Striga resistance or tolerance should be linked with other favourable traits, such as high yield and drought resistance. Tubingen, Germany; Eberhard-Karls-Universitat, 55-65, Press MC; Shah N; Tuohy JM; Stewart GR, 1987. Strigolactones are associated with the negative regulation of root and shoot branching (tillering). Abbasher AA, 1994. The preponderance of the additive gene action over the nonadditive under LN conditions could be attributed to the reported concomitant improvement in LN tolerance associated with the selection for Striga resistant genotypes under 30 kg N ha −1 (Ifie et al., 2015). Several hairy root transformation systems for members of the Orobanchaceae family, including T. versicolor, P. japonicum and Ph. 1A; Mohamed et al., 2001). In both cases, the parasite connects to the host vascular system via a specialized feeding organ, the haustorium.

Relative roles of wind, crop seeds, and cattle in dispersal of Striga spp. DOI:10.1016/j.biocontrol.2007.10.025. In recent years, efforts have been undertaken to elucidate the molecular events underlying Striga infections using next‐generation and conventional sequencing technology (Yoshida et al., 2010a). Flower asymetrically campanulate, the tube 1-2 cm long, bent approximately half way up in West African, Sudanese and Ethiopian populations but usually well above halfway in East African populations (, S. hermonthica may have developed in north-east Africa (. A GWAS performed on a total of 19 RSA and shoot parameters resulted in a list of 32 associated loci, several of them co-localizing with previously identified QTL regions linked to developmental features such as seed weight, seed number, pod number, and Striga tolerance. Sorghum is a major food staple in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but its production is constrained by the parasitic plant Striga that attaches to the roots of many cereals crops and causes severe stunting and loss of yield. Carsky RJ; Singh L; Ndikawa R, 1994. The potential for biocontrol of witchweeds. Strigolactones have been shown to induce the germination of Striga at concentrations as low as 10−16 m (Musselman, 1980). A geographical atlas of world weeds. An exception to this is Phtheirospermum japonicum (Thunberg) Kanitz, a hemiparasitic plant commonly found in East Asia and relatively closely related to Striga. African S. asiatica plants have mainly red flowers. An unknown phytotoxin has been proposed to at least partially contribute to the disease phenotype, but still awaits biochemical identification. Abayo GO; Ransom JK; Gressel J; Odhiambo GD, 1996. and S. asiatica (L.)

After pollination, seeds mature within 4 weeks in seed pods, which contain 250–500 dust‐like seeds of 200–300 μm in size. Striga. and S. parviflora Benth., are present on the Australian continent (Berner et al., 1995). http://ppgp.huck.psu.edu; http://striga.psc.riken.jp. Although some parasitic plants are still photosynthetically active (hemiparasitic), others are not, and depend entirely on a host (holoparasitic). Strigolactones are certainly the best studied and extremely potent inducers of Striga germination. Relative to the host plant, Striga has a disadvantageous leaf surface ratio and might compensate for this with higher stomatal conductance (Press et al., 1987). Striga, commonly known as witchweed,  is a genus  of parasitic plants  that occur naturally in parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Hiraoka et al. A putative homologue of ShContig9483 was found in S. gesnerioides but not Orobanche minor Sm., suggesting that this HGT event might have occurred after the genera split, but presumably before S. gesnerioides evolved host specificity towards dicot plants. ], cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. However, host‐induced silencing of β‐glucuronidase (GUS) gene expression in T. versicolor and the identification of several horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events between S. hermonthica and monocot hosts suggest that mRNA and other RNA molecules could travel between host and root parasite (Tomilov et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2010b). Under Striga-free conditions, 11 SNPs significantly associated with grain yield, number of … Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium of Parasitic Weeds, Nairobi, Kenya, 24-30 June 1991.

Genetic diversity of a parasitic weed, Striga hermonthica, on sorghum and pearl millet in Mali. The genus Striga comprises about 30 obligate root‐parasitic plants, commonly known as witchweeds. Holm LG; Pancho JV; Herberger JP; Plucknett DL, 1979. Unlike the haustoria of plant‐pathogenic fungi or oomycetes, plant haustoria are always multicellular organs with complex anatomies and multiple cell types (Mayer, 2006). Proceedings of the third international workshop on Orobanche and related Striga research, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 8-12 November 1993 [edited by Pieterse, A.H.; Verkleij, J.A.C. Mostly unstudied populations of S. asiatica can be found outside the usual distribution, for example in the Nile delta. If you do not receive an email within 10 minutes, your email address may not be registered, The expression of photosynthesis‐related genes was much lower in S. hermonthica than in Triphysaria, and no expression of these genes was detected in Phelipanche. Unlike Striga asiatica it occurs not only on light, sandy soils but also on heavy clays and even on vertisols. (2009) used a suppression subtractive hybridization strategy of mRNA isolated from Lotus japonicus to investigate differences when infected with S. hermonthica (resistant) or Ph. A. Y., Aba, D. A., Idem, N. U. Biological Control. Hybrid maize breeding for polygenic resistance to Striga has been undertaken at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since the 1980s. Infected tissue, sampled 6 days post‐infection with SG3, was enriched with genes associated with apoptosis, programmed cell death and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Huang et al., 2012). Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. (B, C) Scale bars represent 200 μm. A fungal pathogen with potential for biocontrol of Striga hermonthica (Scrophulariacae). Most Striga species parasitize grass species (Poaceae), but Striga gesnerioides has evolved to parasitize dicotyledonous plants. It is not known whether Striga manipulates host hormone homeostasis directly and how these changes contribute to parasitism. Vatke is the only Striga species that is virulent to dicots (Mohamed and Musselman, 2008). The germination of Striga depends on the perception of germination stimulants released by host roots. Raynal-Roques A; Salle G, 1987. No evidence of large transfers of repetitive DNA regions from the host genomes was observed, which is in contrast with the observed HGT events between monocot genes and S. hermonthica (Yoshida et al., 2010b), and favours the hypothesis that HGT events originate from mRNA species rather than from large pieces of genomic DNA. An estimated 30–40% of maize growing areas infested. Advances in Parasitic Plant Research. Flower colour varies between species and sometimes within species from blue and pink (e.g. If, during that time, no germination stimulant is perceived, Striga seeds fall into a secondary dormancy (Cardoso et al., 2011). This factor is also able to suppress haustoria formation on Z. mays, when Striga plants are attached to T. dactyloides at the same time (Gurney et al., 2003). The establishment of parasitism is essential for holoparasites and several hemiparasites, and therefore these species are called obligate parasites. They also induce hyphal branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, presumably to attract them in low‐nutrient environments (Xie and Yoneyama, 2010). The biology and ecology of S. hermonthica are described in detail by, The main insect natural enemies of S. hermonthica have been catalogued by, S. hermonthica is almost certainly responsible for more crop loss in Africa than any other individual weed species. Nitrogen levels are at least twice as high in Striga as in host plants (Agabawi and Younis, 1965). Wallingford, UK: CAB International. Host plant resistance is the only practical control method. Striga damage rating score is positively associated with Striga emergence counts, and the two traits are negatively associated with yield under S. hermonthica infested conditions. Table 1 con­ tains a list of synonyms, the geographical range, and some hosts of Striga species. The natural host range of S. hermonthica is normally limited to Gramineae [Poaceae], but weak attachment to groundnut, cowpea, lablab and soyabean was obtained in pots by. The distribution in this summary table is based on all the information available. Essential for this step is the perception of haustoria‐inducing factors. Using an inbred line between Nipponbare and the susceptible rice line Kasalath, Gurney et al. Specialization towards holoparasitism then followed in several genera independently, often leading to closely related species with different degrees of parasitism (Bennett and Mathews, 2006). Striga asiatica is the most widespread Striga species (Fig. Since Striga spp. Microorganisms associated with Striga hermonthica and possibilities for their utilization as biological control agents. Infestation of a cereal crop by S. hermonthica may be apparent before emergence from the soil, by the chlorotic blotches on the crop foliage. Biocontrol Science and Technology, 5(2):157-161; 17 ref.

Kim SoonKwon; Adetimirin VO, 1997. CABI is a registered EU trademark. CABI, Undated. Striga hermonthica (Del.) Occurrences of S. hermonthica have also been reported from south‐east Africa. The high transpiration rates of Striga suggest that most host photoassimilates are obtained by transpirational pull, explaining why high humidity is inhibitory to Striga growth.
