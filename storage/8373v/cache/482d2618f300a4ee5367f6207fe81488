The introduction of her American intelligence counterpart Hector Valdez (Raul Casso) strives to rekindle a certain blend of emotional and political complications that permeated “83” and “86.” Still, there’s not enough strength in these sections to hold their own against tracking the myriad ways that HVA alums and their past associates are trying to find their place in a post-reunification existence. Here, there’s a certain bit of continuity tracking where former double agent Brigitte Winkelmann (Lavinia Wilson) ends up after last season’s close. During a tense conversation between Martin and his father/fellow HVA agent Walter (Sylvester Groth), we see the pair through a glass stairwell, where Martin’s faint reflection is cast in the same position as Walter; perhaps a rather blunt visual metaphor, but we are able to step back and see how much Martin has come to mirror the cynical outlook he once despised, a character arc echoed in the rest of the show. 84% Upvoted.
