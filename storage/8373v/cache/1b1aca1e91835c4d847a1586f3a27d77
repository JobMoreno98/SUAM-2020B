Methylnaltrexone was launched in 2008 for the treatment of OIC in patients with advanced illness receiving palliative care, when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. 20. 21. 38. Corrigan, "Preparation and Characterisation of a Range of Diclofenac Salts," Int. 105 (3), 209–217 (1994). Salts are abundantly found in Earth’s crust, They are also found dissolved in the seawater, Cation is a positive ion ( M + ) of the base ( basic radical ) , Anion is a negative ion ( X −) of the acid ( acidic radical ), They are combined together to form salt M + X −. All acidic and basic compounds can participate in salt formation (4). For example, the salts of mineral acids tend to be very polar, leading to increased hygroscopicity and low microenvironmental pH. G.L. 39. Less critical problems could be overcome by a proper development strategy. R.J. Bastin, M.J. Bowker, and B.J. (2010) have stated that depending on the counterion, molar aqueous solubilities of the various salts may differ by more than two orders of magnitude. 7. 9 (5), 809–819 (1983). These salts were found to be crystalline with adequate solubility (comparable with the authentic salts later prepared by the traditional method) and were selected for further evaluation (34). 5–34. Figure 22. The aqueous solubil-ity for this salt form was in excess of 500 mg/ml with a resulting solution pH of<3. The carboxylic stretching band in both compounds is marked by the solid triangle, while the position of the asymmetric stretching mode of the protonated secondary amine is marked by the open triangle. (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1996), pp. Pharm. However, a balanced approach should be adopted because limited resources are available at this early stage of drug development. When the acetyl derivative (310) is used, only isomer (309) is isolated (Scheme 61) 〈57T201〉. R.M. Solvias, "Introduction: Solid-State Development," www.solvias.com/documents/Dokumente/Downloads_news/Solvias_Salt_and_Polymorphism_Programs.pdf, accessed Dec. 30, 2006. As these salts are insoluble in acetone, addition of this solvent precipitates the ammonium salt from solution. R.M. IUPAC defines a salt as a “chemical compound consisting of an assembly of cations and anions.” Mostly, for charge balance, pharmaceutical salts frequently have definite stoichiometry of ionizable drugs (anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic) which via stable ionic bonds with protons transfer from an acid to a base to form salts (Serajuddin, 2007; Bond, 2011; Vioglio et al., 2017). A salt's solubility also depends on the properties of solvent and solid such as the crystal packing and presence of solvates (7). Ionic considerations. Commonly used salts such as hydrochlorides and sodium have advantages over other salt-forming moieties. For example, ranitidine hydrochloride is hygroscopic with a critical relative humidity of approximately 67% (40). 26. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine. Depending on the reaction conditions, low yields of the corresponding bicyclic products are formed 〈43JA29, 70BSF696〉. P.H. The preparation of a stable salt may not be possible for some drugs. Several characterization techniques provide valuable information for salt screening (see Table IV). Salt-selection studies provide a viable extension of a drug's patent because salts with superior properties can be patent-protected. 83–116. The solid is then isolated and recrystallized. New salt forms often have novel physical properties related to processability (e.g., crystallization, morphology, and filtration) and formulation (e.g., stability) (45). In a salt-screening study of RPR111423, a pyridine base, hydrochloride and mesylate salts were formed. To date, BM635-Mes significantly improved the bioavailability with an AUC 4 times higher than BM635, which correlates well with its improved solubility. The major drug-development issues are addressed by choosing the appropriate salt form. The degree of ionization is a critical parameter for the physiological performance of the drug and for its formulation development (25). © 2021 MJH Life Sciences™  and Pharmaceutical Technology. This fact indicates the importance of salt formation in the drug development process. Salt selection is a critical step in the preformulation stage of drug development. An example of this additional stability is the silylation of psilocybin with BSTFA (N, O-bis-(trimethylcilyl)-trifluoroacetamide). 36. This method has a special relevance for poorly soluble compounds because it can rapidly rank compounds based on their solubility, effectively screening out insoluble compounds immediately (13). 15.10) (Elder et al., 2013): where (BH+X−)s denotes the undissolved salt that is in equilibrium with dissolved salt, [BH+]D (aq) is the solubility of the salt, and [X−] is the counterion concentration These effects are more pronounced for salts which have less aqueous solubility. 8. Because the salt formation involves proton transfer with a change in electronic density distribution so the reactivity of the nucleophilic or electrophilic functional groups are modified. However, the availability of many pharmaceutically acceptable counterions makes the salt-selection process difficult and cumbersome. The sulfate salt of methyl pyridinium-2-aldoxime was prepared using silver sulfate as a counterion. Higgins and W.L. Sci. Other advantages of drug salt formation include development of controlled-release dosage forms, improved stability to extend shelf life, targeted drug delivery in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach or intestine), improved taste, improved drug effectiveness, reduced pain on injection, ease of processing, and extended patent life. Pharmaceutical considerations. These salts, in corresponding formulations, were particularly suitable for topical applications. 4). Therefore, a thorough understanding of the salt instability encountered in solid-state formulations is imperative to ensure the product quality. Salt screening starts with the characterization of free acid or base, followed by the identification of possible counterions. Salt formation to improve drug solubility. 30. The use of salts to generate a drug with high water solubility may represent the end goal for preparation of a solution formulation. 41. The scenario in which the generic drug product contains a medicinal ingredient that differs in form (e.g., salt form) compared to the CRP, is contingent on the therapeutic moieties being the same and the safety and effectiveness between the two products being demonstrated to be equivalent. Benzo derivatives (308) and (309) were prepared by Michaelis 〈10LA(373)148, 10LA(373)202〉 by heating a mixture of 2-hydrazinobenzoic acid and ethyl acetoacetate with phosphorus tribromide. For example, they have low molecular weight and low toxicity. J. Pharm. Quaternary salt formation increases the polarity and lowers lipid solubility of the parent compound thereby reducing its CNS penetration and ablating its ability to compromise the central analgesic potential of MOR agonists. The free acid or base of the drug substance is combined with the counterion base or acid in specific molar ratios in a suitable solvent system. Walsh, and ö. Almarsson, "Drugs as Materials: Valuing Physical Form in Drug Discovery," Nat. 2. V.M. Proc. The energy of the ttasymmetric stretching mode of the protonated secondary amine is observed at 1703 cm− 1 in the spectrum of the salt. In some cases, the generics company may decide to develop a new salt form of the original drug substance. J.F. showed that by choice of the mesylate salt form of the API or addition of acidic pH modifiers, which lower the microenvironmental pH, the ester hydrolysis reaction was successfully mitigated to enable a stable DP.3,96 Similar to a stabilization effect, the use of excipients that can destabilize a salt form, as in the case of sertraline salts, was shown to induce conversion to free base in the DP leading to oxidative instability.66 It is also possible that degradation may be exacerbated by salt formation either due to unfavorable microenvironmental pH conditions or direct interaction between the drug and counterion (eg, Michael addition between primary amine and fumaric acid). 9. A generic version of a drug based on an alternative salt form may also be approved in a similar way. The generalized rule of difference in pKa units of the ionizable group in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the acid or base is meant to make the proton transfer energetically favorable. Salt formation may be considered as a way to alter the physicochemical properties of a compound without appreciably changing its chemical structure (although the regulatory bodies consider salt forms as distinct chemical species). 28 (6–7), 943–953 (2004). Fig. Connor and O.I. Bhattachar, L.A. Deschenes, and J.A. FTIR-ATR spectra in the fingerprint region for moxifloxacin (lower trace) and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (upper trace). 12. Salt Formation can not only increase bioavailability but also improve solid state stability whenever the stability of the free base or free acid is in question. For example, the basic amine group in fingolimod exists in essentially the same molecular connectivity pattern as the commonly used buffering agent, tromethamine. Experiments that are more time consuming and labor intensive can be conducted at later tiers. 453–499. The PK profile of BM635-Mes, selected as one of the most soluble salt, was compared to that of both the insoluble BM635-HCl and the free base BM635 (Table 9). These tests are especially relevant in combination formulations such as aspirin–propoxyphene. Techniques for the characterization of salts. By pairing a basic or acidic drug substance with a counterion and creating a salt version of the drug, undesirable features of the parent drug are often overcome. (Wiley–VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002), pp. 42. Table 8. often has certain suboptimal physicochemical or biopharmaceutical properties that can be overcome by pairing a basic or acidic drug molecule with a counterion to create a salt version of the drug Rocco, "Pharma Preformulation: A Stop Along the Drug Development Highway," Today's Chemist at Work 12 (7), 22–26 (2003). S.N. Griesser and D.E. Each salt was examined and evaluated for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties, including MIC against Mtb and aqueous solubility in the Chemiluminescent Nitrogen Detection (CLND) assay, as well as in the Fast State Simulating Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF), which simulates the intestinal fluid (pH 6.5), proving a relevant prediction of in vivo drugs absorption (Table 8). 6 (1), 33–66 (2003). The salts formation was the approach used in 3D-NET projects to increase the solubility of the target molecules. In most cases, the common-ion effect is responsible for reducing drug solubility (Eq. Today 24 (1), 41–44 (2006). Similarly, ciprofloxacin hippurate demonstrated 22-fold times enhancement in aqueous solubility improvement and a faster dissolution rate as compared to the parent form of the drug (Chadha et al., 2016). FTIR-ATR spectra in the high-frequency region of benzylamine (lower trace) and benzylammonium chloride (upper trace). Giovanna Poce, ... Mariangela Biava, in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, 2019, Salt formation is the most extensively used strategy to improve the aqueous solubility of poorly soluble drugs.20 Part of BM635 H2L campaign was focused on overcoming its significant lipophilicity and very low solubility in aqueous media, as well as enhancing bioavailability by preparing a set of BM635 salts. During the screening of salt formation in aqueous media, if the API does not form the salt, it is often advisable to recheck with organic solvents or water/organic cosolvent systems. 33 (1–3), 201–217 (1986). The acid or base characterization provides information for potential counterion selection and for planning relevant crystallization experiments. Because the diastereomers have different solubilities, the least soluble diastereomer will consume the other diastereomer via epimerization until the concentration of the undesired diastereomer drops to the saturation point of the desired diastereomer and the former, being more soluble, is completely dissolved. More conveniently, the racemization can also be performed during the crystallization process, provided the conditions are suitable for both the crystallization and the racemization.69. A.T.M. Everett et al., "Nephrotoxicity of Pravadoline Maleate (WIN 48098-6) in Dogs: Evidence of Maleic Acid-Induced Acute Tubular Necrosis," Fundam. Salt formation is a well-utilized technique to increase the aqueous solubility of a drug. A lack of proper planning may lead to the synthesis of several salt forms of the drug candidate for preformulation testing. Ease of synthesis, handling, or formulation development (27). 198 (2), 239–247 (2000). Using pharmaceutical salts in solid dosage forms can raise stability concerns, especially salt dissociation which can adversely affect the product performance. Discov. Technol. B.D. The main objective of a salt-selection study is to identify the salt form most suitable for development. 16. Limited number of polymorphs or absence of variability because of polymorphism. Therefore, when scientists change the active moiety of a salt that is already marketed, they may usually submit an abbreviated application, popularly known as the 505 b(2) filings (or the hybrid NDA), if they can prove that the new salt form's active moiety has the same pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity characteristics as the original (19). It has been estimated that Before the Voltaren patent expired, other salts (e.g., diclofenac diethylamine) with substantially better skin-penetration properties were discovered and patented. Besides this, the solubility is affected by the counterions in salt, which are present either molecularly (e.g., mesylate, acetate, etc) or atomically (e.g., bromide, sodium, etc) (Vioglio et al., 2017). Various techniques are used for the enhancement of the solubility of poorly soluble drugs which include physical and chemical modifications of drug and other methods like particle size reduction, crystal engineering, salt formation, solid dispersion, use of surfactant, complexation, and so forth. The main concern for the sulfate salt ethanolate was the excessive hygro-scopicity (Fig. Salt-form selection. 19. The salt forms with acceptable hygroscopicity profiles are then evaluated for their solubility. An example of this is the separation of inorganic acids from a solution. Streeter, Eds. © 2021 MJH Life Sciences and Pharmaceutical Technology. If the tiered approach eliminates all the candidates, additional salts must be considered before reevaluating any salt rejected in an earlier tier. This process, dynamic thermodynamic resolution (DTR) bears close resemblance with a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). 32. Salts are composed of related numbers of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions) so that the product is electrically neutral (without a net charge). Purification can also be achieved by salt formation or chemical derivatization. The selection of an appropriate salt form for a potential drug candidate is an opportunity to modulate its characteristics to improve bioavailability, stability, manufacturability, and patient compliance. Pharmaceutical salt selection is extensively described in literature for overcoming poor solubility11,12. Alternatively, several useful properties of salt forms may be explored (6). Berge, L.M. The effect of proton transfer on the spectroscopic properties of a prototypical basic substance can be illustrated for the case of benzylamine. Thus, the solubility of a salt depends on its polarity, lipophilicity, ionization potential, and size. The final salt form selected should have a fine balance of the optimal physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties. As shown in Fig. However, the amorphous form may have advantages (e.g., solubility) that can be harnessed by proper formulation development. However, other salt forms such as mesylate may sometimes offer advantages such as higher solubility and bioavailability (37). 66 (1), 1–19 (1977). In this way, many salt forms can be screened with a minimum of experimental effort. 15. These factors can affect the stability of some drugs due to a consequential increase in the rate of hydrolysis [19]. Tong and G. Whitesell, "In situ Salt Screening—A Useful Technique for Discovery Support and Preformulation Studies," Pharm. However, the success and stability of salt formation depends upon the relative strength of the acid or base or the acidity or basicity constants of the species involved (6). Sci. Furthermore, the originator might choose to … K.M.O. 15. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the salt instability encountered in solid-state formulations is imperative to ensure the product qual … The detection of salt formation with basic substances is not as straightforward as for acidic substances, but the principle of appearing/disappearing bands is still the method of approach. 44. The salt form is then isolated, and the solid precipitate is recrystallized. In certain instances, the use of a model compound can serve as a means to obtain a facile understanding of the FTIR spectrum of a complicated molecule. The term pharmaceutical salt is used to refer to an ionisable drug that has been combined with a counter-ion to form a neutral complex. J.D. 2, 2007. This fact underlines the importance of salt formation for drugs that are designed, developed, and marketed after a rigorous research and development program (1). Salt formation of the ionizable drug molecule is a common strategy to correct the suboptimal drug properties so as to improve physical properties, … In theory, because of the intramolecular ionic interactions, salt formation is associated with higher lattice energy which may typically hinder the overall solubilization process (David et al., 2012; Jain et al., 2015). The crystallization of the salt is achieved only when the drug concentration is adequate with a favorable pH of the solution. Table Ia: Advantages of salt formation for drug properties. 14. Bighley, and D.C. Monkhouse, "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Pharm. Methamphetamine (contracted from N-methylamphetamine) is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity. The salt may have certain undesirable properties compared with the free acid or base, and it would thus be appropriate to develop the free acid or base (28). 10. After the confirmation of salt formation, the prepared salts are screened for various biopharmaceutical properties with a view to selecting the optimal salt form. Converting a drug into a salt through this process can increase its chemical stability, render the complex easier to administer and allow manipulation of the agent’s pharmacokinetic profile. In crystallization induced DTR the racemate is first allowed to react with another optically pure compound to give diastereomers and these are suspended in an appropriate solvent in the presence of a racemization catalyst. lead salt form for development. 2. Additionally, the ethanolate had the potential to change physical form … These types of liquids are often encountered in poisoning cases (e.g., a suspect puts an acidic solution in a victim’s drink) or in clandestine laboratories where acids are utilized in the production of illicit drugs. The value in having a high dissolution rate is that dissolution and the subsequent … This is best explained by the molar free energy of solution, ΔGsoln (Eq. When an active ingredient in a drug product is a salt, the drug product monograph title will 58 contain the name of the active moiety (or neutral form), and not the name of the salt (e.g., Selecting an optimal salt form for development is a critical step in ensuring the efficient and successful development of a robust product. Although counterions are useful in enhancement of solubility, they suffer a drawback, the common-ion effect. Therefore, tolbutamide sodium's corresponding free acid was preferred for oral administration. A. Allerman, "New Drug Watch,"  www.pec.ha.osd.mil/Updates/0307web/Aug-Sep_03_Update_Page_5.htm, accessed Dec. 15, 2006. R. Teraoka, M. Otsuka, and Y. Matsuda, "Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity on the Solid-State Chemical Stability of Ranitidine Hydrochloride," J. Pharm. (Wiley–VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2006), pp. Change of pH, use of buffer, derivatization, complexation and Salt formation. Compounds with a limited number of polymorphs are preferred because their performance during pharmaceutical operations and performance is predictable. Chourasia and S.K. 11. Methylnaltrexone binds MOR with a Ki = 10 nM, ∼25-fold lower affinity than does 3[26]. It has always been assumed that sodium salts dissolve faster than their corresponding insoluble acids. All rights reserved. Changing the salt form during the clinical phase of a drug should be avoided because this is regarded as a change in the drug substance from a regulatory point of view, which results in costly repeated toxicological (‘tox’) bridging studies. These component ions can be inorganic, such as chloride (Cl −), or organic, such as acetate (CH For moxifloxacin, the high-frequency region is not useful in demonstrating the proton transfer that accompanies formation of the salt, but the appearance of the protonated amine band in the fingerprint region is proof of salt formation. Pharm. 47. G. Davies, "Changing the Salt, Changing the Drug," Pharm. Similarly, for the preparation of salt forms of acidic drugs, the pKa of the counterion should be at least 2 pH higher than the pKa of the drug. Illustration energy maximums and minimums for DTR (a) and DKR (b) processes. Psilocybin (the active drug present in psilocybin mushrooms) undergoes thermal decomposition on heating due to the loss of the dihydrogen phosphate ester group; therefore, due to the heat of the injector, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis produces chromatograms and spectra that are identical with psilocin. L.F. Huang and W.Q. Engel et al., "Salt Form Selection and Characterization of LY333531 Mesylate Monohydrate," Int. Harry G. Brittain, in Profiles of Drug Substances, Excipients and Related Methodology, 2018. 5, 2007. 28. As a example, the molecule 11B and their salts were evaluated and a different activity was observed related only to their different solubility. 161–189. USP, USP 29–NF 24 (US Pharmacopeial Convention, Rockville, MD, 2006). While BM635-HCl proved roughly the same Cmax (579.1 ng/mL) as the free base (638.3 ng/mL), BM635-Mes showed a Cmax four times higher (2970 ng/mL) than both the free base and BM635-HCl (Table 9). Pharmaceutically accepted hydrochloric (pKa = − 7), methanesulphonic (pKa = − 2), phosphoric (pKa = 2.12), tartaric (pKa = 3.01), and citric (pKa = 4.78) acids were selected to prepare BM635 saline forms.21. 34. Submitted: Apr. Toxicol. 266 (7138), 322–323 (2001). (Wiley–VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002), pp. Wermuth, Eds. 35. After synthesis, the formation of the salt forms must be confirmed. Knowing that an acid plus a base yields a salt plus water, concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added to the acidic solution, which forms an ammonium salt with the acid. adopted a multitiered approach to screen salts for their optimal physical forms (39). Bighley, S.M. Pharmacol. Atorvastatin calcium was originally developed in an amorphous form. Sci. This fact indicates that the salification, or salt formation, of a drug substance is a critical step in drug development (1, 2). Pharmacological safety studies are also performed. The expectations of the salt form must be outlined as a desirable pharmaceutical profile that guides the synthesis of the salt forms (see Table II). However, the hydrochloride salt of ranitidine has better absorption properties compared with the free base and is one of the most successful drugs ever marketed. 23. Tong, "Impact of Solid State Properties on Developability Assessment of Drug Candidates," Adv. Res. This hurdle may be overcome by racemization of the unwanted enantiomer as discussed above. Adderall and Mydayis are trade names for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine.The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, the two enantiomers of amphetamine. J. Pharm. For a rational approach to salt screening, the tiered approach should be combined with a goal-oriented approach in which the main problems associated with the free acid or base are handled first, followed by secondary problems. As estimated, about 50% of all drugs used in medicinal therapy are administered as salts. According to in vitro results, BM635 salts conserve activity against Mtb and the hydrochloride exhibits a significant advancement in anti-mycobacterial activity (MIC = 0.08 μM) compared to that of BM635 and other salts. Anderson and R.A. Conradi, "Predictive Relationships in the Water Solubility of Salts of a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug," J. Pharm. 1–7. Unlike 3, 4 had a positive intrinsic activity (consistent with partial agonism) both in [35S]GTPγS exchange and guinea pig ileum contraction assays [26]. They may also result in the detection of new polymorphs (1). Moreover, this hit-or-miss approach results in many failures and may cause the loss of test substance and time. Their properties are compared during a preformulation program that improves the chances of selecting the optimal salt form (29). SALT FORMATION- It is one of the common approaches used to increase drug solubility and dissolution rate. The positions of the symmetric and antisymmetric N–H stretching modes in the free amine group of benzylamine are marked. • For drug products for which the name and strength are expressed in terms of active Stahl and C.G. 117, L. Ohannesian and A.J. "Ophthalmic/Otic Dosage Forms," www.cop.ufl.edu/safezone/prokai/pha5100/eye.htm, accessed Dec. 20, 2006. Table IV: Techniques for the characterization of salt forms. 37. When the commercially available product for that drug is expressed in terms of the salt or ester of the drug and different salts and conversion of different salts or esters of the drug is done to the referenced salt. If the active compound is a liquid, a solid dosage form is usually preferred because oil is difficult to purify, characterize, and maintain in its effective form. Both techniques involve addition of a chemical to react with the target component to form a complex, which has properties allowing it to be separated from the rest of the mixture. (Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 20th ed., 2002), pp. (Wiley–VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002), pp. High-throughput synthesis has gained greater importance in the salt-selection process. Objectives of salt selection. Nonionized drug dissolution. Dev. Stahl and C.G. Sci. Decreasing development timelines intensify the pressure to select the right salt form the first time. The USP Salt Policy, applies to “all new drug product monographs for products that contain an active … Thus, hygroscopicity needs to be carefully monitored when designing a salt form of a drug. In spite of the abundance of available counterions, few are used frequently. The speeds of reaction of these enantiomers with an optically pure compound will be different and thus one product (enantiomer or diastereomer) will be formed faster than the other. (2005) demonstrated enhancement of aqueous solubility saccharinates of different drugs, viz, quinine, mirtazapine, haloperidol, pseudoephedrine, risperidone, lamivudine, venlafaxine, sertraline, zolpidem, and amlodipine, when compared to free base. Sci.75 (5), 492–496 (1986). Wermuth, Eds. - … The extended delay showed by BM635-HCl could be explained by a slower dissolution rate compared to BM635-Mes. During salt-form selection, the determination of pKa and corresponding ionizable groups gives an idea of the feasibility of salt formation. Pratap Chandra Acharya, ... Rakesh K.
