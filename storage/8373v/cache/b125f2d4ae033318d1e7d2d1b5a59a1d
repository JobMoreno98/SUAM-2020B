I don't think there was one upbeat moment in this book. Paul Lynch is the prize-winning Irish author of four novels: BEYOND THE SEA, GRACE, THE BLACK SNOW and RED SKY IN MORNING. A bleak novel about rural Ireland in 1945. He makes every image seen and at the same time felt tactilely and emotionally.

Mikhail Bulgakov was born in Kyiv, Russian Empire (today Ukraine) on May 15 1891. Fun, light, well written, but for some reason you’re just not sucked in. The story starts off on a sad note and stays there throughout the entire book. This was appalling for me because it was as if you were watching your favorite movie, and right at the climax of the film the electricity goes out! It appeared to be as absurd and at the same time deep as is Gogol's best work. “След около половин час седяхме в ресторант „Неапол“ до един прозорец пред лекьосана покривка. Especially hilarious are the scenes where the playwright watches the company "rehearse" his play through a series of exercises designed by the "Stanislavsky" character which have little to nothing to do with the text and involve company members not even in the show. It starts with a tragedy; it ends with one. Yes I knew it was a dark story but either the author should write a novel or write poetry, thus tries to combine the two but the over use of descriptive text is tedious and as you pick your way through the story the characters become unreal. If you are in the theatre, you are taught to revere Stanislavsky and his acting methodologies. Immensely powerful, but subtly so. It’s hard to understand A Dead Man’s Memoir without having some kind of knowledge about the literary and theatrical world of the Soviets in the 30’s.

Nothing good or upbeat happens and it gets to a point where you have to stop reading and put the book down because you start to feel as depressed as the story. Bulgakov certainly did not like Stanislavsky and his Method! Wow, not one good thing happened in this book. This is an enchanting work, but it’s also an unfinished novel as Bulgakov decided to give his attention to The Master and Margarita instead, which is the novel I first read from him and it became one of my favorite novels ever. The story however which starts with a fire on a farm in Ireland and takes you with the family's effort at recovery, is grisly, dark and at times upsetting. This is of course a narrower world than that covered in his masterpiece "The Master and Margarita", but the same wide-eyed innocence of the narrator, which precisely because of this allow. INCREDIBLE writing! Lynch has an interesting and beautiful way with words. Fame, at home and abroad, was not to come until a quarter of a century after his death in Moscow in 1940. Paperback.
