Amol Palekar took over the reigns for this telling, which is the novels second bow on the big screen. I was a little worried when I read what it was about, but I think that it was handled really well, at least for Bollywood. Of course, I would still prefer Veer-Zaara and Devdas plot-wise, but the scenery in this film is simply breathtaking. Rahul Joshi wants to be a successful businessman so he works hard for his boss Siddharth. The "Most Anticipated New Indian Movies and Shows" widget tracks the real-time popularity of relevant pages on IMDb, and displays those that are currently generating the highest number of pageviews on IMDb. The song 'Dheere Jalna', has always been my favourite since i had the soundtrack for the first time and it was put in the movie wonderfully. Shah Rukh brought his unique and mature attitude to the screen once again and Rani just looked amazing. SRK plays two characters - one who would rather do bookkeeping on his wedding night and then leave on a 7 year business trip the next day, and the other a ghost who takes his place with the new bride. Rani Mukerjee acted superbly and there is a delightful cameo role by Amitab Bachan There is humor, joys and sorrows in this film. Shah Rukh is the accounts obsessed ever obedient groom (Kisen) who has to leave right after marriage to go for business to another town far away. A fairy tale set in a time long ago, with ghosts, apparitions, camel races, vibrant and often clashing colors, divine music, innocence and love - what is to not like? The sequence where a ghost morphs into a Crow and then to a Squirrel, followed by a bird and finally a Man is mesmerizing. One day Rahul meets Seema, an up and coming model, and he feels like he's finally met his match. This film is absolutely excellent. Songs were nice and even better were their videos, especially the one during the end credits. Great script and there was plenty of time to build relationships. During the annual camel race, Sunderlal loses the race to the Thakur and out of shame leaves home, never to return. It wasn't modern but it wasn't too 'villagey' for me not to love.     |                         Get a sneak peek of the new version of this page. This kind of prevented me from taking the film seriously.However, a very nice set design and simply superb colours made the film not entirely a joke.The cast, as expected, was superb. Rani is the young innocent bride Lachchi who gets married and starts on a journey to her new home. The epic tale of King Asoka's life is recounted. This review might include a spoiler, although I will try not to write anything beneath my opinion, that has not been said in the film description. Most Anticipated New Indian Movies and Shows, Certificate: 13+ They both loved laachi..only one was willing to risk it just to be with her. Written by He gets him engaged to Ganga, his friend's daughter, and brings her to USA. Look at the different number of expressions Shahrukh has given every time while mumbling same line-"Phal..Phool Gulabjal". True the story is mythical but quite allegorical. The fact that Shahrukh had to approach,look at himself and talk to himself, expected me to see him look a bit far to the left or right, but yet this was spot on! It makes koi mil gaya look a bit cheap, (sorry to Koi mil gaya fans!) Paheli is a love story based on "Duvidha", Vijaydan Dethan's re-telling of a classic Rajasthani folktale. Also, rani mukherjee and big b in the cast certainly added to the shimmer. The special appearances were also much appreciated; Juhi making a now rare appearance in mainstream films! Then Lachchi gets pregnant and on the day of the child's birth the ... Showbiz History: Batman's debut and JLaw's second Globe win, ‘Sing Street’ Broadway Cast Premieres ‘Riddle of the Model’ Video, Harley Quinn Season 2 Episode 2 Review: Riddle U. Cinematography (Ravi K. Chandran) and Visual Efx (Eagle Video Films-Prime Focus) is first rate. Paheli is a rare film.Its beautifully mounted and photographed with amazing backgrounds and costumes - totally suited to the traditional tale. (Never mind if he is competing with fellow actor Aamir who produced "Lagaan'). But once the imaginative leap has been made and its premise accepted, the film is pure delight. Probably one of the greatest Hindi mainstream films of the decade, Chak De India was a treat to watch, it still is! Paheli is an unusual film on the subject of women's rights disguised as a love story. Kishorilal wants an Indian bride for his westernised son. In an Indian village, a struggling barber sees his luck begin to turn when residents learn that a famous actor he once knew is coming to town. Where I don't think this is one of the finest performances of his career, it should at least appease those who are always accusing him of lacking versatility. I rushed to the nearest cinema to watch "Paheli" as i believed it is a good movie and really the movie is good and the story is also very different. Lachchi's goodlooking, but mind-weak husband leaves her after one night because his father wants him to. The story is unbelievable for many people but acting and direction of the movie are awesome. I must give Shahrukh credit for daring to do such an unconventional movie with so many risk factors--it's a fantasy film; the lead actor is a ghost; it is narrated by animated puppets; etc. On the night of their marriage, he leaves to pursue his business interests. All in all, in one word the whole viewing experience can be described as "Phenomenal". Visuals were absolutely stunning! He played the role of the Indian women’s hockey team coach Kabir Singh, who leads his team to a world cup victory. Rani and Juhi both look beating in Rajasthani dress as they look like Marwadi. After seeing the guy struggle even after trying a lot of different things since 2010, I was kind of intrigued with the film choices that SRK have made over time, and Paheli is a pleasant surprise. All in all, the film is fun to watch, although I feel 'Parineeta' was much better. So 140 minutes later, I emerged quite pleased at the way the evening went but another hour later on the train home, there was no waves of images and thoughts heading back to my brain except for some bright colours and the visual recreation of the spectacle of Rajasthan. . Paheli as many may know is based on an Indian novel 'Duvidha' by Vijay Detha. The special effects are the best! Red Chillies Entertainment [India] (English), Film City, Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It is basically the story of a young woman, Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) who is abandoned by her husband Kishan (Shah Rukh Khan) the day after their wedding. Enjoy!!!! The director does an excellent job in capturing all the picturesque sceneries from all the most suitable angles. The movie went on to become a hit and SRK was awarded Filmfare Award for the best debut male. Sub plot of Juhi Chawla and Suneil Shetty also has nothing to contribute to the narrative. The settings. Yeah I mean really every other actor has won an award for Best Villain, a Critics Award and a plethora of Best Actor awards for their monotonous work. Usai pesta pernikahan, Kishan meninggalkan istrinya untuk urusan pekerjaan. Title: Movie Name Release Dates Heroines Poster Deewana 1992 Divya Bharti Chamatkar 1992 Urmila Matondkar Dil Ashana Hain 1992 Divya Bharti Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman 1992 Juhi … it is no use asking how can a ghost impregnate a woman.

Shahrukh Khan is one of the biggest superstars of Bollywood today along with Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, and Akshay Kumar. Director: Raj Kanwar | Stars: Rishi Kapoor, … The performances are really strong. Directed by veteran actor Amol Palekar, this Bollywood fantasy drama had Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukerji in the lead. Pleased with this, Bhanwarlal does not object to Kishanlal's return. I must admit this is the first time that I have seen a movie directed by Palekar, and he has left me with a good taste so I'm sure to rummage through some movie store looking for more of his work. And judging from the reaction I saw most people in the theater really enjoyed the movie. For me it re-created my sub continental childhood when we were brought up on stories of princesses and Djinns in fantasy palaces-romantic and emotionally satisfying. You definitely will not be disappointed. Add the first question. The movie is set in a time in India, where girls weren't ask whether they wanted to marry or not. I watched Palekar's "Paheli" today. Rani and Juhi were also great. I have just seen Paheli and I think it was very good. Juhi's role shouldn't be missed....despite her role seeming very small, it was incredibly big. The actor has recently completed 25 years in Bollywood and it has been a fantastic box office journey for SRK. Keep track of everything you watch; tell your friends. A tearful Lachchi bids him goodbye, but to her pleasant surprise he returns within a few days, and informs his dad that he met a holy sage who had instructed him to return as he will find five gold coins every morning. I even managed to find a film poster for my collection. Three cheers to Shahrukh for he took a great leap by lending his hands to this film by not just acting in it but also producing it. I respect Palekar as a director - this happened right after I watched his "Thooda Sa Roomani Ho Jaaye" starring Nana Patekar. 17 of 24 people found this review helpful.

Each title is ranked according to its share of pageviews among the items displayed. The novel centers on a love story between a ghost and a woman whose husband leaves her on the night of their marriage to go on a business trip. I suggest everyone to go and watch it!!! Surely, Vijayadan Detha's novel, Duvidha, on which this movie is based could not have had such an abrupt ending and even if it did I am sure that there would have been a lot more finesse and emotion attached then the one that we got to saw in this movie. This will go in the classics, I hope this gets the international recognition it deserves.

The film was well-made. A word of advice for Shahrukh, stick to such cinema rather than doing those mindless NRI romances, as you will gradually find a rather larger audience never mind if it takes another 2-3 attempts.

Need some help finding the best things to watch on Netflix? Lachchi is facing 5 years of loneliness. A man submits himself completely rules laid down by his forefathers. my next favourite is the song when Kishanlal (the real guy) was remembering laachi. I went to see this title purely out of curiosity - amol palekar, being more than a revered god in our household and srk's grand charisma covering all promos from head to toe. It wasn't the typical 'here is Laachi...Here is Laachi's husband Kishanlal...Here is Laachi's sister in law', the whole opening displayed each character beautifully. When Kishanlal reappears only a few days later, Lachchi is delighted, but this new Kishanlal is in fact a spirit who has taken the form of Lachchi's husband, after having seen her by chance and fallen in love with her. User Ratings They have three children, son Aryan Khan (b.

I am a bit sick of all the movies that Bollywood that has been churning out recently with an emphasis on skin show and a story line that follows a course of some not so great to begin with Hollywood movie. Slow pace of the movie makes the fine performances of SRK and Rani Mukherjee forgettable. At some times in the movie she acted so well that i could feel her very emotions and wanted to basically cry as she did on the screen. The special effects are very typical of Bollywood but they don't really affect the movie very much and they are relatively short so I didn't mind them. Amitabh Bachan also looks like a typical Rajasthani person and he lived his role beautifully. He has made few movies, but each one of them has been critically acclaimed. the VFx is also good. Weird head gear aside, it's … Rajpal Yadav is a great comedian. Rani is great first a rejected bride and then a woman who finds true love with a ghost. A wonderfully romantic film with great actors, beautiful music and fantastic visuals. Will Seema fall for Rahul? Is it superfluous or sumptuous?
