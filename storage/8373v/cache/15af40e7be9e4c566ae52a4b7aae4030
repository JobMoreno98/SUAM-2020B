Spinal compression and the resulting relief is a known issue with this disorder. Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column. With milder forms of Spina bifida such as Occulta, may be related to the degree of strain on the cord which can become worse with physical activity, injury, pregnancy, bone spurs, or spinal stenosis. 2019 Sep;5(3):337-350. doi: 10.21037/jss.2019.09.02.

This procedure offers a unique benefit in that the spinal cord remains fixated to the spine, preventing retethering and spinal cord injury as possible surgical complications. a series of patients with neurologic symptoms associated with low conus and/or thick filum identified on iophenyldate myelography 4. Delayed cervical spinal cord tethering following tonsillar resection for Chiari malformation. A tethered cord, h… Br J Neurosurg. In adults, onset of symptoms typically include: Neurological symptoms can include a mixed picture of upper and lower motor neuron findings, such as amyotrophy, hyperreflexia, and pathologic plantar response, occurring in the same limb. tethered cord syndrome, led to a proposal to treat asymptomatic patients prophylactically, ‘‘in the hope of obviating the development of symptoms during adolescence’’ [16]. When the spinal cord cannot move freely because it is attached to spinal tissues, we refer to this as tethered cord syndrome.                 FOIA In contrast, occult tethered cord syndrome is a recently defined entity, where the management is still controversial. This occurs because the spinal cord in a child with Spina bifida is low lying and tethered at the bottom. The untethering process can improve the oxidative metabolism and can help to repair injured neurons. Tethered spinal cord can be caused by various conditions but the main cause is when tissue attachments limit the movement of the spinal cord in the spinal column which causes abnormal stretching of the cord. a disorder in which the spinal cord is \"stuck\" to a structure within the spine such as dura, scar tissue from a previous operation, a bony spicule or even a tumor. Tethered Cord Syndrome After Myelomeningocele Repair: A Literature Update. Bhimani AD, Selner AN, Patel JB, Hobbs JG, Esfahani DR, Behbahani M, Zayyad Z, Nikas D, Mehta AI.
