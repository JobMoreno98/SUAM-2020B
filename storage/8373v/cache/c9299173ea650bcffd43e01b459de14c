The hull was constructued with both transverse and longitudinal steel frames, 13 watertight compartments and a double bottom running 2/3 of the hull’s lenght. Blücher was built at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel between 1907 and 1909, and commissioned on 1 October 1909. The support of the Blücher by the flanking move would have brought my formation between the British battlecruisers and the battle squadrons which were probably behind. In the course of the engagement, Blücher had been hit by 70–100 large-caliber shells and several torpedoes. [27] At around this time, Blücher scored a hit with a 21 cm shell on Lion's forward turret. Introduction ↑. After being commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1909, Blücher served as a training ship for naval gunners starting from 1911 and in 1914 was transferred to the I Scouting Group with Von der Tann, Moltke, and Seydlitz. She struck two mines and quickly sank; only 127 men out of the crew of 629 were rescued. [9] The highest power ever achieved by a reciprocating engine warship was the 37,799 indicated horsepower (28,187 kW) produced by Blücher on her trials in 1909. [32], As the ship was sinking, British destroyers steamed towards her in an attempt to rescue survivors from the water. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as "Ersatz (name of the ship to be replaced)". [18] At 03:20, CET on 15 December 1914, Blücher, Moltke, Von der Tann, the new battlecruiser Derfflinger, and Seydlitz, along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary. Meanwhile, at 1030, Blücher was hit by a shell from HMS Princess Royal, which caused an ammunition fire and boiler room damage. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper. She was not subjeted to pitch, but had a severe roll and with the rudder at 90% she heeled over up to 10°, loosing as much as 50%+ of her speed. The ship carried a total of 11 torpedoes. The Blücher was now out of action, and the Arethusa gave the coup de grâce by slipping in two torpedoes at her just as we slewed around. Hartlepool replied with its coastal artillery, Seydlitz was hit three times and Blücher received six hits, suffering minimal damage but with nine killed and three wounded. One of the ship's survivors recounted the destruction that was being wrought: The shells ... bore their way even to the stokehold. Emphasis was on protection. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, but the battlecruisers were some 50 km (27 nmi; 31 mi) ahead. [14], Blücher was also equipped with four 45 cm (18 in) torpedo tubes. He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl. They register about 12,000 tons; and are 525 feet long, 62 feet wide and 45 feet deep, with quadruple expansion engines, developing 8,000 horse-power. However, the destroyers withdrew when a German zeppelin began bombing them, mistaking the sinking Blücher for a British battlecruiser. [19], On 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser Magdeburg had run aground in the Gulf of Finland; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found code books used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. However contrary to the previous Scharnhorst class she had a rather light protection, and a main artillery distributed like the Nassau and Helgoland classes of battleships. SMS Blücher, first German battlecruiser. She still had a arm bow, a long forecastle on which was mounted her fore artillery turret, four twin turrets on both sides with recesses for forward and aft fire, and rear turret. Four of these guns were mounted in casemates near the bridge, four in casemates in the bow, another four in casemates at the stern, and the remaining four were mounted in pivot mounts in the rear superstructure.

When the intel derliver a report of the building on the new Invincible class, it was expected ships equipped with six or eight 9.2 in (23 cm) guns. Blücher was built at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel, between 1907 and 1909, and commissioned on 1 October 1909. The ship had a beam of 24.5 m (80 ft 5 in), and with the anti-torpedo nets mounted along the sides of the ship, the beam increased to 25.62 m (84 ft 1 in). Of the three screws one was larger than the others, for cruise at lower speeds. The ship served in the I Scouting Group for most of her career, including the early portion of World War I. The last cruiser of the battle line was now under heavy fire. The light cruiser Augsburg encountered the armored cruisers Bayan and Pallada north of Dagö (now Hiiumaa) island. [31] Figures vary on the number of casualties; Paul Schmalenbach reported 6 officers of a total of 29 and 275 enlisted men of a complement of 999 were pulled from the water, for a total of 747 men killed. However, the three leading German battlecruisers, Seydlitz, Derfflinger, and Moltke, had concentrated their fire on Lion and scored several hits; two of her three dynamos were disabled and the port side engine room had been flooded. Blucher was named after Gebard Leberecht von Blucher (1742-1819), the Battle of Waterloo hero, and followed the original SMS blucher of the World War 1 period into service (this particular vessel was lost in January of 1915). HMS Princess Royal was the second of two Lion-class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before the First World War. The terrific air pressure resulting from [an] explosion in a confined space ... roar[ed] through every opening and [tore] its way through every weak spot ... Men were picked up by that terrific air pressure and tossed to a horrible death among the machinery. [9], Blücher was launched on 11 April 1908 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1909. The resurrected Blucher displaced 17,820 tons under standard load and up to 18,500 tons under full loads. [34] Admiral Hipper had originally intended to use his three battlecruisers to turn about and flank the British ships, in order to relieve the battered Blücher, but when he learned of the severe damage to his flagship, he decided to abandon the armored cruiser. This loss angered the Kaiser that decided against other actions for the time being and sacked Rear Admiral Eckermann and admiral Ingenohl. 47 Cruisers 13 Heavy Cruisers. [13] The shells were 45.3 kg (99.9 lb),[14] and were loaded with a 13.7 kg (30.2 lb) RPC/12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge. So the end result was no match in size, armament and speed to true battlecruisers. [10], Blücher was equipped with twelve 21 cm (8.27 in) SK L/45[d] quick-firing guns in six twin turrets, one pair fore and one pair aft, and two pairs in wing turrets on either side of the superstructure. Cloud Computing! The SMS Blücher was named after a great Prussian general of the Napoleonic era and co-winner at Waterloo. [22], By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. [31] She continued to resist stubbornly; Blücher repulsed attacks by the four cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers. Learn how your comment data is processed. [20], On the night of 15/16 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. The rumors had been confirmed. However British cryptographers of Room 40 were soon able to locate the German operational area so the British massed an impressive force to try to catch them: Beatty’s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Gordon Moore’s 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, Commodore William Goodenough’s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron and Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt’s Harwich Force. Their high explosive shells weighed 10 kg (22 lb),[14] and were loaded with a 3 kg (6.6 lb) RPC/12 propellant charge. [18], Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet, decided that another raid on the English coast should be carried out in the hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of the German squadron, decided to abandon Blücher to the pursuing enemy ships in order to save his more valuable battlecruisers. On the way, a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight, so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved and they could safely navigate the defensive minefields. Raid on Yarmouth, 2 November On 2 November 1914, the I scouting group left the Jade Bight and arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak, shelling the port, and SMS Stralsund laying a minefield. At 03:20, 15 December 1914, SMS Blücher, Moltke, Von der Tann, Derfflinger, Seydlitz, and light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, Graudenz, winged by two squadrons of TBs left the Jade, sailed north past Heligoland, reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, and turned towards towards Scarborough. At 11:48, Indomitable was ordered by David Beatty to finish off the battered Blücher, which was now the subject of an inferno as coal in the emptied bunkers took fire. warships, submarines, uboats, passenger liners, sailing ships, fishing vessels, cargo ships, merchant ships, ship database German WW1 dreadnought SMS Oldenburg. Germany built the Blucher to counter the new Armored cruisers rumored as being built by the British, the Germans expected this new ship to be armed with 6 or 8 230mm guns, so they designed the Blucher to have 12 210mm guns, significantly more powerful than Germany's last Armored cruisers of … Illustration of the Blücher, by the author (1/400), Your email address will not be published. [9] Each shell weighed 108 kg (238 lb), and was 61 cm (24 in) in length. The ships were designed to engage the reconnaissance forces of rival navies, as well as fight in the line of battle. Although a powerful ship she was overshadowed by the British introduction of the battlecruiser, Blücher being to far advanced to either cancel or be modified. SMS Blücher. Your email address will not be published. The British ships were now silent, but their torpedoes had done their deadly work. Graudenz and Stralsund were assigned to the forward screen, while Kolberg and Rostock were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. The sinking of Blücher - The King's Choice (2016) - YouTube Blücher's metacentric height was 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in). Unfortunatey for the Germans, when the Blücher emerged as completed in October 1909, the British were already starting the construction of their second generation battlecruisers, and she was obsolete. [9], The ship had a designed maximum speed of 24.5 knots (45.4 km/h; 28.2 mph), but during her trials, she achieved 25.4 knots (47.0 km/h; 29.2 mph). These ships were supported by the four light cruisers … Hipper eventually turned south at 23 knots (43 km/h; 26 mph), Blücher’s maximum speed while the chasing British ships were abover 27 knots. In 1914, she was transferred to the I Scouting Group along with the newer battlecruisers Von der Tann, Moltke, and the flagship Seydlitz. [29] At 11:48, Indomitable arrived on the scene, and was directed by Beatty to destroy the battered Blücher, which was already on fire and listing heavily to port. Twelve hours after, the High Seas Fleet departed in turn (14 dreadnoughts, eight pre-dreadnoughts, two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, 54 TBs) sailed as a backup and trap force. SMS Blücher[a] was the last armored cruiser built by the German Empire. [b] Her design was influenced by the need to match the armored cruisers which Britain was known to be building at the time. In 1913 she was fitted with a tripod mast, the first on a German ship. She was not interned at Scapa Flow at the end of the war like the bulk of the High Seas Fleet, and was scrapped in Holland in 1921. On the other hand, Blücher sank at her first combat, just like her WW1 namesake. She was designed to match what German intelligence incorrectly believed to be the specifications of the British Invincible-class  battlecruisers. Secondary armament was mounted in barbettes. Despite of this and due to her 28,532,000 Goldmarks price tag, she was deployed with the battlecruiser squadron. The secondary battery counted eight 15 cm (5.91 in) quick-firing guns inside C/06 casemates among which four centered amidships on either side. Though the ship would be much larger and more powerful than previous armored cruisers, Blücher retained that designation in an attempt to conceal its more powerful nature. The armored cruiser Yorck made a navigational error that led her into one of the German minefields. She took part in the operation to bombard Yarmouth and the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914. [31], By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded HMS Princess Royal, the German ships had too great a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase. [17], On 2 November 1914, Blücher—along with the battlecruisers Moltke, Von der Tann, and Seydlitz, and accompanied by four light cruisers, left the Jade Bight and steamed towards the English coast. In the course of the engagement, Blücher had been hit by 70–100 large-caliber shells and several torpedoes. Compared to the Scharnhost, the new cruiser was 3000 tons heavier, 20m longer, and 3m wider. The armored belt was supplemented by a 3.5 cm (1.4 in) torpedo bulkhead,[9] though this only ran between the forward and rear centerline gun turrets. The guns could be depressed to −5°, elevated to 30° with a top range of 19,100 m (20,900 yd) and rate of fire was 4–5 rpm. But as I was informed that in my flagship turrets C and D were out of action, we were full of water aft, and that she had only 200 rounds of heavy shell left, I dismissed any further thought of supporting the Blücher. The Blücher was the last armored cruiser built for the Imperial German Navy. HMS Princess Royal was the second of two Lion-class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before the First World War. Now all her guns has been silenced, and the British cruiser reloaded and launched another seven more torpedoes at point blank range. Soon after HMS New Zealand also opened fire on Blücher and with the decreasing range, Hipper ordoned all his ships to open fire. Required fields are marked *. A volley of seven more torpedoes was launched at point-blank range; these hits caused the ship to capsize at 13:13. Blücher was the only warship lost during the battle. As a result, Blücher had to reduce speed to 17 kn (20 mph; 31 km/h), and fell further and further behind the rest of the German force. He however ordered his battlecruisers to open fire on the “tail” of the German line, therefore all British ships targeted the already batterred Blücher which would received about 70 large caliber hits. SMS Blücher was the first and last German monocaliber armoured cruiser. However Blücher was about to be left alone as Beatty received reports of U-boats in the nearby area, and manoeuvered to sail back. The concentration on Blücher allowed Moltke, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger to escape. As a result, Blücher had to reduce speed to 17 kn (20 mph; 31 km/h), and fell further and further behind the rest of the German force. [31] A further twenty men would also die as prisoners of war.[32]. The ship was named after the Prussian This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming toward Hipper's ships. [32] Massie's "Castles of Steel" also has a great write up of this battle, and of British/German navel battles of WW1 in general. In the end, only 6 officers and 275 enlisted men suvived. The largest naval battle of WW1 up to that time, Dogger Bank was the first … [28] At 10:30, New Zealand—the fourth ship in Beatty's line—came within range of Blücher and opened fire. [16], The forward conning tower was the most heavily armored part of the ship. The previous Scharnhorst-class had eight guns, in two twin turrets fore and aft and in barbettes. [26] Aurora challenged Kolberg with a searchlight, at which point Kolberg attacked Aurora and scored two hits. [f] The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at 27 kn (50 km/h; 31 mph), and quickly caught up to the German ships. Shortly thereafter, Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters. The ship was named after the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher, the commander of Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. German armored cruisers—referred to as Grosse Kreuzer (large cruisers)—were designed for several tasks. These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy. [25], Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. This was not an all-or-nothing scheme. When the details of the Invincible class came to light, it was too late to redesign Blücher, and there were no funds for a redesign, so work proceeded as scheduled. trying to save themselves before she goes down. The german armoured cruiser eventually capsized and sank for good at 13:13. The British Grand Fleet, comprising some 200 ships, was based at Scapa Flow at the beginning of WW1. Later on September she sailed with the IV Squadron (7 dreadnoughts, five cruisers, 24 destroyers) trying to draw out a the Russian fleet and search for a decisive victory. [9] The torpedoes carried a 110 kg (240 lb) warhead and had two speed settings, which affected the range. The hull armour was made of Krupp cemented armor, with variable thickness between the most vital areas and the others. Under heavy fire from the British ships, she was sunk, and British destroyers began recovering the survivors. [13], Blücher was also armed with sixteen 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK L/45 quick-firing guns, placed in both casemates and pivot mounts. Contemporary German naval doctrine called for a scouting group to be made up with at least four large ships, or half a squadron. Hipper’s next sortie, however, was intercepted on its way out: on January 24, 1915, in the Battle of the Dogger Bank, the German cruiser Blücher was sunk and two other cruisers damaged before the Germans could make their escape. The number of casualties is unknown, with figures ranging from 747 to around 1,000. The rumors had been confirmed. Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing. Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. Maybe the Deutsche Marine should reconsider its criteria for deciding Instead the Von Der Tann was built in 1908-1911, this time with correct intel and the right specs. In fact, HMS Invincible carried eight 30.5 centimetres (12 in) guns of the same type mounted on battleships. The ship had a single rudder with which to steer. She was however really the last German Armoured cruiser, following the famous Scharnhorst class. Meanwhile, at 1030, Blücher was hit by a shell from HMS Princess Royal, which caused an ammunition fire and boiler room damage. [7] Blücher was therefore arguably obsolete even before her construction started, and was rapidly surpassed by the German Navy's battlecruisers, the first of which (Von der Tann) was ordered in 1907. The shell failed to penetrate the armor, but had concussion effect and temporarily disabled the left gun. Rate of fire was 15 rpm, 10 kg (22 lb) high explosive shells and maximum range 10,700 m (11,700 yd). [6], One week after the final decision was made to authorize construction of Blücher, the German naval attache obtained the actual details of the new British ships, called the  Invincible class. She was the lead ship of her class, which were nicknamed the "Splendid Cats". en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Bl%C3%BCcher https://www.fr.naval-encyclopedia.com/1ere-guerre-mondiale/Kaiserliche-Marine.php#crois https://www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/kaiserliche-marine.htm https://www.sms-navy.com/ Specs Conway’s all the world fighting ships 1906-1921. [25], On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with Seydlitz in the lead, followed by Moltke, Derfflinger, and Blücher, along with the light cruisers Graudenz, Rostock, Stralsund, and Kolberg and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. The battle-cruisers moved to Rosyth in December 1914, but it took until April 1918 to make the estuary safe enough for the rest of the Fleet to join them, by which time every significant harbour had been taken over for naval use. However it was too late for the Blücher which after two hours had exchanged volleys and was now badly hit, listing to port. She was the lead ship of her class, which were nicknamed the "Splendid Cats". The first was an armoured cruiser in WW1, the last a heavy cruiser in WW2. See, In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (, Beatty had intended to retain only the two rearmost light cruisers from, Throughout the war, the German Navy suffered from a chronic shortage of high-quality coal. [9], Blücher was equipped with three vertical, 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines. At 10:28, Lion was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker. By 10:35, the range had closed to 17,500 yd (16,000 m), at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Blücher was larger than preceding armored cruisers and carried more heavy guns, but was unable to match the size and armament of the battlecruisers  which replaced armored cruisers in the British Royal Navy  and German Imperial Navy  (Kaiserliche Marine). She was quickly indeed sometimes wrongly classified as a “battle cruiser” because of her monocaliber artillery. One of the pre-WWI 28cm guns; As the lead ship, identified as KMS Blücher, a German heavy cruiser, continued, she came into the sights of the 61-year-old Kommandørkaptein Anderssen’s torpedoes. Of the three towns, only Hartlepool was defended by coastal artillery batteries. This provided a cruising radius of 6,600 nautical miles (12,200 km; 7,600 mi) at a cruising speed of 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). [21] By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward. Not so much: Blucher both the WW1 and WW2 ships were lost with large loss of life. Her hull was constructed with both transverse and longitudinal steel frames and she had thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for approximately 65 percent of the length of the hull. Beatty ordered Indomitable — his slowest ship — to intercept Blücher. Heavy cruisers of Hochseeflotte are not only smaller than their contemporary British counterparts (Both Scharnhorst 1906 displaced 12,300 tonnes vs. Warrior/Minotaur classes being over 13 500 tonnes, 6 x234 and 4 x190 mm versus 8 x210 mm and less protection. The ship was designed to carry 900 t (890 long tons) of coal, though voids in the hull could be used to expand the fuel supply to up to 2,510 t (2,470 long tons) of coal. Provisionally known as “E”, she was first drawn to match contemporary British armoured cruisers. HMS Lion was a battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. She took part in the operation to bombard Yarmouth and the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914. They register about 12,000 tons; and are 525 feet long, 62 feet wide and 45 feet deep, with quadruple expansion engines, developing 8,000 horse-power. If the last: the Admiral-Hipper class of heavy cruisers will be the Tier VIII ship, so not specifically the Blucher under that moniker, but the class of ship of which the Blucher was one of the three will be present. [2] The earliest armored cruiser—Fürst Bismarck—was rushed through production specifically to be deployed to China to assist in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. S119 was the lead ship of the torpedo boat flotilla and was commanded by Korvettenkapitän Thiele himself. The 15 cm turret casemates were protected by 14 cm of armor. Battle of the Dogger Bank, 23 January 1915 The Blücher would met her fate at the Battle of Dogger Bank, on January 1915: on 23 January, Hipper, knowing British ships were doing a recce mission around the Dogger Bank area sailed out with Seydlitz followed by Moltke, Derfflinger, and Blücher supported by light cruisers and 19 torpedo boats. [29], The British attack was interrupted due to reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships. Each engine drove a screw propeller, the center screw being 5.3 m (17 ft 5 in) in diameter, while the outer two screws were slightly larger, at 5.6 m (18 ft 4 in) in diameter. [33] Among those who had been rescued was Kapitan zur See (captain at sea) Erdmann, the commanding officer of Blücher. The coal in the bunkers was set on fire. [31] Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the destruction of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz, and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. [11] The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to 30°, providing a maximum range of 19,100 m (20,900 yd). This was significantly more firepower than that of the Scharnhorst class, which carried only eight 21 cm guns. [25] To counter it, Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Gordon Moore's 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron and Commodore William Goodenough's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were to rendezvous with Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force at 08:00 on 24 January, approximately 30 nmi (56 km; 35 mi) north of the Dogger Bank.[25]. Blücher had a draft of 8.84 m (29 ft) forward, but slightly less aft, at 8.56 m (28 ft 1 in). Named for Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the Prussian victor of the Battle of Waterloo, the ship was laid down in August 1936 and launched in June 1937. The armored deck was between 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) in thickness; more important areas of the ship were protected with thicker armor, while less critical portions of the deck used the thinner armor. The CT (Conning Tower) was made of 25 cm (9.8 in) thick walls and 8 cm thick roof, while the the rear one had 14 cm (5.5 in) walls and 3 cm roof.
