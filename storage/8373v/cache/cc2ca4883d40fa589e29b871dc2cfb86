Princess Allura is to her misfortune, the love interest of Prince Lotor in the anime series, Voltron (known in Japan as Beast King GoLion). Lotor loved Allura, and she in turn got close to him to the point of making Lance jealous. They return to the Castle just as the others are about to pass out from lack of oxygen. It’s primarily a fanfiction archive for my works, focusing on the pairing of Prince Lotor of Doom and Princess Allura of Arus. The Paladins of Voltron have defeated Emperor Zarkon and accepted the peace treaty with King Lotor. His role is to show the dark side of Altean ambition, and to show that "I want to rebuild the Alteans" can take one of two paths. Also, because of Allura's close relationship with Keith, Lotor was also obsessed with beating or killing him out of jealousy. Lotor is gifted in the use of other melee weapons. Creeper Lotor from the original had an obsession with Allura, to the extent that Haggar and Zarkon both questioned his sanity numerous times. I have been a fan of this pairing since I was a young child. Meanwhile, Allura and Lotor both face off against the White Lion guardian, and where Lotor fights and is ultimately kicked out of the temple, Allura unlocks the secret to Altean alchemy already hidden inside her. Prince Lotor is a character from theNetflixTV series Voltron: Legendary Defender. The Princess of Planet Arus, her kingdom was nearly destroyed by the forces of Planet Doom when she was a baby, and then she was raised in hiding. Team Voltron defeated Lotor in an onslaught of quintessence thanks to Allura’s powers. There are some who hate this alliance with King Lotor and will do anything in their power to stop it. Allura was born before Lotor, but because she was put in a stasis sleep for 10,000 years and he instead experienced those 10,000 years' worth of time, Lotor is older than her. Mar 17, 2020 - Explore Ana Banannas's board "Allura and Lotor" on Pinterest. The line in the sand is drawn and Pollux is caught in the crossfire when Lotor strikes in retaliation on Allura's behalf, testing the limits of trust, friendship, and love of all involved.  There’s just something about a blue skinned prince who doesn’t take no for an answer. They are both the Galra Emperor and the Altean Alchemist, and it’s repeatedly implied that where Zarkon and Honerva made the wrong choices, Lotor and Allura will make the right ones. Lotor and Allura’s relationship is written as a parallel to Zarkon and Honerva, with the couples representing selfish and selfless love respectively. Lotor appears to take a sadistic delight in misery and pain. But with the universes's new era, many problems have risen. Lotor is a selfish individual, caring only for what he wants. The Season 6 finale of Voltron: Legendary Defender saw the sacrifice of the Castle of Lions, the return of the real Shiro, and one particularly pivotal moment — the end of Lotor.

She eventually becomes one to the leader of Voltron, Keith. 1 Character 2 Ships 2.1 Het 2.2 Slash 2.3 Poly 2.4 Family 3 Canon 4 Fanon 5 Fandom 6 List 7 Trivia 8 References 9 Navigation Lotor is the son of Emperor Zarkon and is summoned to temporary lead the Galra Empire in his father's stead when Zarkon becomes comatose. Any "weakness" Lotor displays on his own part is a ruse or other ploy to either gain advantage or in the case of his lost duel versus his father Zarkon, a means to save face.
