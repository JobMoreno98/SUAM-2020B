The incident is reported by Hazrat Anasra in Sahih Muslim: “The Holy Prophetsa invited Despite the fact that the Prophetsa of Allah instructed him not to do so and fear God, he did it anyway. It coincided with the nature of the Holy Prophetsa, who Aishara narrates that from among the wives of the Prophetsa, Zainabra. regarding purdah were revealed. falsely that I have heard or seen anything. Zainab bint Jahsh was the Muhammad's cousin, her mother Umayma being the daughter of Abdul Muttalib, Muhammad's grandfather, who, while he was alive, had ensured the safety of his grandson, thanks to his position as one of the most respected leaders of the Quraysh.Thus Zainab came from one of the noble families of the Quraysh, and everyone expected her to eventually marry a man with the … an opportunity to defame her and accused her of being disloyal to the Holy When Zaynab heard this she was stunned; she told him that she was from a noble family and she was neither keen nor willing to marry a freed slave.

When he went to her, she was kneading dough; keeping his back turned to her, he gave her the Prophet's message, that he wanted her to join the select group of the Mothers of the believers. She said she had never seen any other person who was so eager to get closer to Allah to gain nearness to Him she was more charitable than most, and her generous behavior with relatives was impeccable. Moreover, to presume that the Prophetsa was immediately mesmerised by her beauty was absurd. 'Umar Faruq led the funeral prayers and all her close relatives - Usamah bin Zayd, Muhammad bin' Abdullah bin Jahsh, 'Abdullah bin Abi Ahmad bin Jahsh and Muhammad bin Talhah bin 'Abdullah got down into the grave to lower her gently into her final resting place in Jannatul Baqi'.

Zaynab felt guilty and realized that she committed a grave mistake and offended the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). Hence, in the words of Hazrat Mirza Bashir Her sister was another famous women Companion, Hamnah bint Jahsh.
