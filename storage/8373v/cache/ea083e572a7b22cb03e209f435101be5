In RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks. Instead of using a simple parity to validate the data (as in RAID-3, RAID-4 and RAID-5), it uses a much more complex algorithm, called a Hamming Code. One of the characteristics of RAID 3 is that it generally cannot service multiple requests simultaneously, which happens because any single block of data will, by definition, be spread across all members of the set and will reside in the same physical location on each disk. They are linked together to prevent data loss and/or speed up performance. It is either built into the motherboard, or added to the motherboard. The mentioned Operating Systems RAID Questions are asked in the previously conducted interviews and examinations. RAID-3 consists of byte-level striping with a dedicated parity.

RAID 0 gives faster read and writes speed capabilities, whereas RAID 1 has less writing speed but better read capability. A Level 1 RAID array provides redundancy by duplicating all the data from one drive on a second drive so that if one of the two hard drives drive fails, no data is lost. It is because rebuilding is the simplest job for level 1. c) Using better quality disks 3 9. As in RAID level 1, … By Practicing  3.
