Imagine for a moment that you’re back in May of 2017. ( Log Out /  There are two broad shortcomings that almost every generic RPG falls into: Some, like Savage Worlds and Genesys, are not particularly more hackable than any other RPG and end up feeling like games that the setting was cut out of (which, in both of those cases, is technically true).

This week's topic is Cortex Prime RPG, which we discussed in our live chat. The system is a generic system that was derived from the Serenity and Battlestar Glactica game (and others) also produced by the same folks. The organization of Cortex Prime is aimed at players for 8 pages and GMs for the rest, because the book is not a playable game out of the box…it’s even less of a playable game out of the box than Fate or GURPS. Cortex Prime almost falls into the latter category, but escapes it by virtue of clear writing, excellent layout, and more, better worked examples than are available in the core rulebooks of any of the above four games. Hopefully someone who's played a bit more can give you a more comprehensive overview. First the news: if you haven’t heard, Fandom bought the Cortex RPG system and hired on Cam Banks as Creative Director.Okay, now I’ve said that twice. Tales of Xadia is a new tabletop roleplaying game developed by Fandom Tabletop, and it's based off of Wonderstorm's animated series, The Dragon Prince.More and more shows are getting the tabletop treatment these days, from Rick and Morty to Stranger Things.Both of those series chose to work with publishing giant Wizard of the Coast to create Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks, but … Note that the older Serenity RPG used what is now called the Cortex Classic system.

As more options are defined, so too are more ways to earn and spend Plot Points. Why the price shot up over night is beyond me. Similarly, the base advancement mechanic measures only sessions that have passed, but mods can get you Technoir-like stress-based advancement or Burning Wheel-like Belief mechanics if that’s the way you want to go. While there might be a hidden lesson in this, what we the readers benefit from is the choice to either go more modern or D&D-adjacent, losing nothing in the choice thanks to the game’s adaptability. This does mean that it might sometimes be advantageous to choose a lower absolute result (provided it still meets the threshold for success) if it produces a larger Effect Die.
