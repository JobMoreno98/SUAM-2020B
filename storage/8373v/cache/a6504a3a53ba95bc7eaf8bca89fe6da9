Excerpts from Gustave Le Bon "The World of Islamic Civilization" (1974) “Islam, from among all religions, best suits the science discoveries and is the most ready to edify souls and force them to abide by justice, kindness and toleration.” “With the flourishing of Arab civilization, religious toleration was absolute – a fact for which we have brought more than one indication.

Heraclius launched several campaigns against the Sasanians, who had been occupying much of the Middle East, including Damascus and Jerusalem, for nearly a decade. Thereafter Syria, Baghdad, and Persia became similar channels for the communication of essentially Greek, Syriac, pre-Islamic Persian and Indian cultural values.

As a result, Muslims of the Abbasid period quickly set about recovering the scientific and philosophical works of the classical past—lying neglected in the libraries of Byzantium—and translating them into Arabic. The most interesting accounts of other cultures encountered by Arab Muslims are contained in a book on the travels of Ibn Battutah of Tangier (1304-1377), who over a period of 25 years traveled to Asia Minor, Mongolia, Russia, China, the Maldives, Southeast Asia and Africa and recounted his travels and the influence of early Muslim traders in those regions.

The death of al-Farabi is perhaps a fitting event to mark the end of the golden age of Muslim science. This is why, just as many Greek texts now survive only in Arabic dress, many Arabic scientific works only survive in Latin.

General Characteristics of Islamic Civilization. =Civilization of the Arabs. Islam was destined to become a world religion and to create a civilization which stretched from one end of the globe to the other. In 661, after the murder of 'Ali, the Umayyads gained control of Islam for the next several hundred years.

The enormous intellectual energy unleashed by the Abbasid dynasty left no field of knowledge and speculation untouched. These dynasties included the Samanids (819–1005) in eastern Iran, the Fatimids (909–1171) and Ayyubids (1169–1280) in Egypt and the Buyids (945–1055) in Iraq and Iran. The Ottoman Empire emerged about 1300 CE as a small principality on former Byzantine territory. Alexandria in the fourteenth century had 12,000 students.

From the second half of the eighth century to the end of the eleventh century, Islamic scientific developments were the basis of knowledge in the world. Victor Hugo writes of Persians as do Boccaccio and (Chaucer). Rather, they had first to be rendered in Syriac, the language with which Christian translators were most familiar, and then translated into Arabic by native speakers. The story of Islam's role in the preservation and transmission of ancient science, to say nothing of its own lasting contributions, is truly fascinating—and a bit of a puzzle. The Illustrated History of the Ancient World. Because Islam is a holistic religion integrating all aspects of life, it follows that a reform movement predicated on religion necessarily confronts the social, economic, and political realities of the society in which it develops. But medical science soon led into zoology, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, pharmacology and chemistry. One of these was Thabit ibn Qurra. One of the interesting results of these trading relations occurred during the caliphate of Harun al-Rashid (786-809) when he exchanged envoys and gifts with Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor.

Under Umayyad control, the civilization expanded from a group of loosely and weakly-held societies in Libya and parts of eastern Iran to a centrally-controlled caliphate stretching from central Asia to the Atlantic Ocean. Thus contemporary political-religious groups focus on social, political, and economic aspects of Muslim societies. Islamic civilization stands apart from its peers by virtue of the fact that it emerged well over a millennium later. To do that, they emphasized their family lineage down from Muhammad, rather than his Quraysh ancestors, and transferred the caliphate center to Mesopotamia, with the caliph 'Abbasid Al-Mansur (r. 754–775) founding Baghdad as the new capital.
