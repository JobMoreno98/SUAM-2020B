It is a humbling and relevant tome that describes the catastrophic failures of leadership and American hubris that led to the inevitable disaster in Vietnam. And so on. A Soldier with a Sordid Past Devoted to a Doomed War, I liked it a lot. Amy Madigan seems to have a knack to play the angry housewife/mother. 20 New Books on Women’s History. The "Bright Shining Lie" lay not in the stated aspirations of Cold Warriors or Flak-Catchers but in the ideology that advocated construction of such bloated government in the first place. With Bill Paxton, Bo Eason, William L. Mansey, Karina Logue. Prevost strapped the pair of Armalites to the support struts under the wings of the L-19 and invented a contrivance of wire that enabled him to pull the triggers from the cockpit to strafe guerrillas he sighted. $18.95 While it offers some historical background, this isn't a general history of the war or of America's involvement in Vietnam. I think I leapt headlong into the subject because I was convinced that this was where America started to get it really wrong--fighting colonialist wars, whose outcomes were manipulated by unscrupulous actors like Nixon and Kissinger; having the knowledge of the atrocities we were capable of but not holding ourselves accountable, because patriotism/tribalism wins out over the humanity of the brutalized other; the dawning feeling of vulnerability and decay that is still being exploited by demagogues to speed, rather than reverse, our decline. But like I say, I've only started reading this; I've gleaned much already in Neil Sheehan's first chapter. The "Bright Shining Lie" lay not in the stated aspirations of Cold Warriors or Flak-Catchers but in the ideology that advocated construction of such bloated government in the first place. Journalist that provided the stories that the "media" wanted. However, this movie could have been much better. I suspect that should I read it now I would give it more stars. Cornelius Mahoney "Neil" Sheehan is an American journalist. The movie seemed to capture the earlier years WAR very well.

When confronted with his self-evident guilt by the girl's father, he marries her. I'm assuming that Ken Burn's series on Vietnam will drive further interest in Sheehan's story, and that will be good as it, I skimmed this book again over the last couple of weeks having plowed my way through it over some months in 1989, me a 30 year old twit in grad school in New Hampshire, co-reading with my historian of war Dad in Wyoming. This passionate, epic account of the Vietnam War centres on Lt Col John Paul Vann, whose story illuminates America's failures & disillusionment in SE Asia. The high velocity caused the small bullet to inflict ugly wounds when it did not kill.) I started reading this today while waiting in the long line at the polling booth; I thought it entirely appropriate on election day to begin reading a book about a war and the conflicting policies that got us into it and kept us in it, since all the hubris and misguided do-goodery and righteousness that got us into Vietnam is of the same ilk as has gotten us into the current mess. The work done in preparation and the use of documentary style presentation was effective, and gave the movie and story credibility. Through the life of the tenacious antihero John Paul Vann, Neil Sheehan explains the doomed American engagement in Vietnam with compelling, unflinching clarity. Preparing for promotion to high rank, he went to Vietnam in the early 1960s as an adviser, one of the select few to take the fight against Communism right into combat. A BRIGHT SHINING LIE John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam By Neil Sheehan Random House. . Naval War College Digital Commons. We’d love your help. However, all hands do a credible job and it's worth watching. I remember that this was the human story version of a work I greatly admired and emulated in its model of content analysis: Griffin and Marciano's Teaching the Vietnam War (, Nominally a biography of John Paul Vann--a soldier and civilian who was one of the first American Advisers in Vietnam at the beginning of American intervention and remained involved in the conflict until his death in 1972--this is actually the most complete history of the Vietnam War that I have ever read. Could it be the idiot journalists that were there, who benefited, even though they never left the "parties" of Saigon except to visit secure areas? One scene that especially stood out was when Bill Paxton rushed to the village only to see it get destroyed. Consequently, author Sheehan begins, after a brief review of Vann's funeral, with a description of the war from what appears to be a supportive position. We need to coopt the communist revolution by getting rid of the corrupt and cowardly Vietnamese officers and giving the rice back to the peasants or something like that. He is a pro-military, conservative (Boll Weevil) type Democrat, and everything I read across the disciplines were pushing me further and further hard-left.

Not so here. He wants to win the war but feels it's being fought inefficiently. John Vann was a unique character in the war both as a soldier and an officer and ultimately as a civilian involved in depth with the decision making process at the highest levels. Sheehan's book is one of them, and it shows. For a TV Movie, this film was good. Could it be the ringleaders of the Peace movements who were nothing more doped up morons who spent much of their time seducing underage girls, getting high and raving regarding things they knew nothing about. The acting is OK, but no one really stands out, including Paxton. But Vann was also a man with deep personal issues: haunting, shaming memories of childhood poverty, a weak father & a libertine mother, leading perhaps to his own aggressive infidelities including one with an underaged girl that nearly led to court-martial. A Bright Shining Lie shows not only that Vietnam was an impractical misadventure but also that what the United States did was shameful. Will report back when I know more... Well, I finally finished this beast last night, and with it my sudden interest in anything and everything Vietnam War. This TV movie is simply awful!

I don't really care for Amy Madigan, but she portrayed Mary Jane Vann divinely. A Bright Shining Lie John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam By Neil Sheehan Knopf 896 pp. I'm assuming that Ken Burn's series on Vietnam will drive further interest in Sheehan's story, and that will be good as it includes remarkable historical detail from the Pentagon Papers and also journalistic accounts that didn't always make it into the US media coverage of the war. Vann, it seemed, wanted America to be not just committed to victory when waging war, but to be consistent in its philosophical and humane concerns. The 1989-published Bright Shining Lie covers the life of US Army Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann and the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Paxton has his work cut out as the very complicated Vann, a dedicated soldier who is not only everything an Army officer should be, but also a true warrior whose devotion to victory trumps his loyalty to the establishment & thus even his own career. Vann didn't approve of how it was conducted, but throughout he believed he knew how the 'hearts and minds' of the southern population of Vietnam could be legitimately captured. Much better reading for making policy decisions than "The Pet Goat.".

All reviewers All stars. 862 pp. I think I leapt headlong into the subject because I was convinced that this was where America started to get it really wrong--fighting colonialist wars, whose outcomes were manipulated by unscrupulous actors like Nixon and Kissinger; having the knowledge of the atrocities we were capable of but not holding ourselves accountable, because patriotism/tribalism wins out over the hum. Wouldn't you be, with a mother like mine?) And his "fight" in Vietnam was merely a series of bureaucratic exercises in which the Americans were bogged down by South Vietnamese intrigues, both unwilling & unable to do what was necessary to defeat the Communists. I recommend it to anyone interested in American military history, specifically the Vietnam war, but warn you that you are in for a long, difficult read. Yet Sheehan's Vann has a shocking capacity for self-harm, hating the ignominious background that was not his fault, indulging himself in sexual adventures that wounded his family & threatened his career as readily as he embarked on reckless combat missions. There's a lot of other history I want to tackle. Well, I did it. Donal Logue made the perfect reporter as well. "A Bright Shining Lie" is another thought provoking war film that I highly recommend.
