Did Duny, like in the fairytale, really need to be transformed back into human form? WARNING! Calanthe hands Eist her sword and appears to agree to Duny’s proposal. As the viewers know, Queen Calanthe has already arranged the match for Pavetta behind the scenes. When Duny arrives to claim his bride due to the Law of Surprise, Calanthe is ready to strike him down but eventually relents. He has come to claim it, by the Law of Surprise. Sometime prior to 1249, Pavetta met a man named Duny and the two instantly fell in love, even after she learned he was cursed and had a hedgehog-like head during the day. In fact, maybe she prefers hedgehogs. He claimed he was cursed from birth and did not know why, Duny had previously saved Pavetta's (Ciri's mother) fater and invoked *sigh* the law of surprise in payment. But then the show (and the short story) takes a step back and transforms Duny into a handsome prince (who would’ve been soooo much older than Pavetta too). But things go completely off the rails when a helmeted knight named 'Duny' arrives to do more than request Pavetta's hand. The Last Wish‘s short story leaves the reason for Duny’s claiming of Pavetta unclear. Did Queen Calanthe relent because she recognized that her daughter was in love… She had a daughter named Pavetta. A man cursed to be hedgehog like beast from dawn to midnight. Ciri , the child she was carrying, was marked by Destiny as Geralt named her as his reward for saving Duny… (Did I mention Duny … Pavetta (b. The content below has massive spoilers if you haven't read the books! Emhyr was originally introduced under the alias Duny. But, at least The Witcher sidesteps this by revealing that Pavetta and Duny are somehow in love, even though the man has the head of a gopher. Pavetta screams and reveals her powers. Pavetta states that she loves Duny and she will marry him. But really Emhyr was the heir to the throne of Nilfgaard but was banished and cursed.  When Pavetta and Duny die in a shipwreck, Calanthe's only remaining heir is Ciri. Unbeknown to almost all, Duny had already made her acquaintance a year earlier, though, and the two had fallen in love, so far that Pavetta was pregnant by the time of "A Question of Price". 1234 - d. 1257) was the princess of Cintra, daughter of Queen Calanthe and King Roegner, and the mother of Ciri. Geralt helped remove the curse, and in return asked for their child - Ciri, Emhyr/Duny agreed, but never fulfilled his promise. The banquet hall turns into a chaotic maelstrom, and at the eye of the storm is Pavetta (speaking Elder) and Duny. But she draws her dagger and tries to kill Duny. Cintra was one of the major kingdoms in the northern realms ruled over by Queen Calanthe.
