If you search for “backup Kubernetes” on google you will probably find quite a lot of different solutions. there is only one master node left in my old configuration and I want to know which Deployments.yaml I deployed there. In this post I’ll focus more on the technical side of creating backups with a tool called Velero previously known as Heptio Ark. Velero can be used both on public clouds as well as on-premise clusters. Now, we know how the container works and that it exports the data to pg_backup, we are left with the Kubernetes Resources: CronJob Resource. General Configuration Tips When defining configurations, … The CronJob resource is defined in the file ./aks/pg-backup-cronJob.yaml. Kubernetes cluster backup and recovery is critical for business continuity and avoiding extended applications/cluster downtime. With Velero, you can do disaster recovery, data migration, and data protection. Back Up Deployments. Unfortunately, many of them do not explain the big picture. This demo will guide through a sample demonstration for how to use Velero to backup an AKS cluster in Azure Storage Account. Backup and Restore. Velero is the leading tool for creating backups for Kubernets configuration and application manifest YAML files and Volumes. Velero is also supported by the Microsoft Azure and GCP cloud platforms. Both backup tools do not work with Azure Blob Storage, which is not … This document highlights and consolidates configuration best practices that are introduced throughout the user guide, Getting Started documentation, and examples. If you think of something that is not on this list but might be useful to others, please don't hesitate to file an issue or submit a PR. Edit a Backup’s Settings; Stop, Restart, or Terminate a Backup; View a Backup’s Snapshots; Delete a Snapshot; Resync a Backup; Disable the Backup Service; Restore Deployments. Backup Preparations; Back up a Deployment; Manage Backups. Both operators allow users to store backups on S3-compatible storage and leverage Percona XtraBackup and Percona Backup for MongoDB to deliver backup and restore functionality. Deploy the above restore manifest to the cluster kubectl apply -f k8s-restore.yaml -n velero Kubernetes Cluster Backup, Restore and Disaster Recovery Made Easy with Velero and Rafay. There are pages pointing out that you should do backups, some references to solutions like Velero and descriptions for how to back up etcd. Percona Kubernetes Operators allow users to simplify deployment and management of MongoDB and MySQL databases on Kubernetes. A backup opertaion is uploads a tarball of copied Kubernetes objects into cloud object storage. Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. When you create a backup, you can specify a TTL by adding the flag --ttl <DURATION>. Optionally you can specify hooks to be executed during the backup. Once installed and running, it will backup all Kubernetes resources to S3 compatible object store and make a snapshot of persistent volumes. Introduction. In this post in our Kubernetes consulting series we’re going to cover Kubernetes backup with Velero, previously known as Heptio Ark, within an AWS environment. In my previous blog post on Managed Kubernetes in the Cloud I’ve explained more on the theoretical side of managed Kubernetes services and upgrade strategies.
