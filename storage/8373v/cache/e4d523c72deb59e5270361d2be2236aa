In 2009, during the filming of Deathly Hallows: Part 2 she developed shingles (a painful skin rash), but still continued the film despite the pain. Utterly furious at this downright trickery, she deducted fifty points from Slytherin and put the quartet in detention. Minerva McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor, and later Headmistress at Hogwarts. [19], The professors moments after Ginny Weasley was kidnapped by the monster, When Ginny Weasley was later taken into the Chamber of Secrets, where "her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever", Minerva despairingly believed that they were facing the end of Hogwarts. [3] When Hermione was attacked by the Basilisk in 1992, Minerva was greatly moved and would often take time to visit her Petrified student in the hospital wing.[19].

Wie Zaubereiminister Lupin gestern Nachmittag bei einer Pressekonferenz bekanntgab, erlag die wohl mächtigste Hexe ihrer Generation …  	 	Lord Voldemort[8] This particularly strong concern for Harry, clearly above what Minerva felt for most other individual students, was later shown in his third year: She proved she cared far more for Harry than winning the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor, ensuring he was kept in maximum security and limiting his time to practise and even not hesitating to confiscate the Firebolt he was given to out of concern it was sent by Sirius Black and instantly lost her temper when Oliver Wood suggested Harry be allowed to fall off his broom as long as he caught the Snitch, intimidating Wood into submission. After he had graduated and then returned as the Potions master, he and McGonagall became colleagues. The troll was not there upon their entry, but a terrible racket from an upper floor provided a clue. Wie ihr Nachname und ihre Vorliebe für Schottenkaros andeuten, stammt sie aus Schottland. I have always deemed Professor McGonagall an ideal teacher. She supported him unequivocally even though she had never been fully in his confidence. [21], Once the Second Wizarding War had begun, Minerva joined the Order of the Phoenix and spent much of the summer of 1995 doing work for the Order. [3] Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted  to stay or evacuate for the Battle of Hogwarts as a respect for their valour and rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk  dying in battle despite their desires. When Minerva was attacked by several Ministry employees outside of Hagrid's Hut, Hermione showed deep emotion towards the event, like Minerva did a few years before. [12], Harry informed McGonagall of a quest that Dumbledore had left him. Minerva was positively hateful towards Lockhart when he walked in late and oblivious when everyone else was greatly saddened at Ginny Weasley's impending doom. [3], During his second rise to power, Minerva joined the Order of the Phoenix and stayed in Hogwarts during the tenure of Severus Snape as Headmaster and the Carrows to protect her students. Harry acted as a frequent guest lecturer on Defence Against The Dark Arts, under Minerva's jurisdiction. Given her adoration of her Muggle father and continuing love for Dougal, she deplored these ideas. McGonagall was very angry by Crouch's teaching methods and shouted at him. When Minerva was attacked and sent to St Mungo's, Dolores was pleased that she at last had complete control of Hogwarts. This is McGonagall's sweetest moment. During the Sorting ceremony, he was - to no one's surprise - sorted into Gryffindor House. At first Minerva was baffled due to how advanced the charm was but ultimately agreed to teach them if they proved themselves sufficiently adept, impressed by their desire to help Hogwarts and study Transfiguration. Despite their boisterous ways, at odds with Minerva's no-nonsense reputation, they seemed to have a good relationship with her.  The couple would later become Head Boy and Head Girl; neither appointment would have happened if their Head of House had not approved, which means she trusted them. However, they were still close friends, were both members of the Order of the Phoenix, and admired Albus Dumbledore. Minerva, believing his escape was motivated by fear, called him a coward as fled the school. Ihre auffallende Loyalität gegenüber Dumbledore gründet in einem vertrauten Gespräch der beiden über Minervas Muggelliebe und Dumbledores verschwiegene Kindheit, das sie von da an in tiefer Freundschaft verband. [12], In her free-time, Minerva was known to enjoy needlework.[1]. [1], Through her early years at Hogwarts, Minerva remained close friends with her former boss in the Ministry, Elphinstone. She tried to comfort Harry about the death of Dumbledore but her efforts fell short, as she herself was devastated at the death of her beloved teacher. [3] When Neville "lost" his scrap of parchment (which was actually stolen by Crookshanks) with Gryffindor's passwords on them, allowing Sirius Black to enter the common room, Minerva was furious with him. McGonagall knew that Snape was a Death Eater in his youth, but she followed Albus Dumbledore in believing that he truly regretted his former allegiance. By then, her parents lived on the outskirts of Caithness in the Scottish Highlands, in a village where mostly Muggles lived. In the final moments of the battle, she duelled Voldemort himself to a stalemate alongside Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt, though they were blasted aside by his fury when Bellatrix Lestrange was killed in a duel with Molly Weasley. Minerva saw this appointment as an affront to the school itself and did little to hide her disgust. The timeline suggests that the character was forty-six when she and Dumbledore left Harry with the Dursleys, was fifty-five when Harry started Hogwarts, and sixty-two by the Battle of Hogwarts. It was later noted that the Gryffindor Quidditch team had, despite some injuries on the part of the players, a fine showing that season, as had the Slytherin team, which the Headmistress herself judged to have been deserving recognition for their successes. 	4 October[1]Caithness, Scotland, Great Britain 	 Minerva then intervened on his behalf after he told her that Alecto wasn't responding.

Marital status 	Affiliation   Before coming to the school, she visited Diagon Alley and purchased her wand from Ollivander's Wand Shop. Peter faked his own death standing up to Sirius, who was a suspect in the Potters' betrayal, leading McGonagall to regret that she had been harsh towards him and to acknowledge him as a brave Gryffindor. When the Gryffindor house ghost, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, was spirited away by the Calamity along with the cup and turned him into a Foundable, Minerva was delighted to see his safe return, stating that she had meant to ask his opinion on the Calamity, seen as how he, being somewhat separated from his original self, just like the Foundables were, perhaps had some interesting insights into the Calamity they had not considered. 		Species However, rather than punishing or expelling him for having broken Madam Hooch's order that no student would ride on their broomsticks and the risk he took, Minerva brought him to see Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, announcing that she had found their new Seeker. When Neville Longbottom admitted to having written the passwords down, McGonagall banned him from future Hogsmeade visits for the rest of the year, gave him a detention, forbade anyone to give him the password into Gryffindor Tower and wrote to his grandmother. With both Carrow siblings now incapacitated, Minerva used the Imperius Curse to gain their wands, before she magically restrained and confined them to the Ravenclaw Common Room.

Like the rest of the faculty, Professor McGonagall did everything she could to protect the students, although they were ultimately unable to prevent the injury of several students and the death of a Slytherin student named Duncan Ashe; this all led to Jacob's expulsion. She also wanted to keep Harry out of the explanation the imposter was about to give, believing Harry had had enough, but reluctantly conceded to Dumbledore's wish that Harry stay. Thus, for the first time in years, McGonagall's house was the current house cup champions.

When Hermione explained about their first Divination, McGonagall understood and asked her class which of them would be dying this year. In the films, McGonagall appears to be older than she is described in the books. They both survived the war and still taught at Hogwarts. [12] In the aftermath of the battle, Professor McGonagall brought the winged bore statue's part in the battle to the attention of Professor Flitwick, who thought it an unlikely story seen as no one was known to have enchanted them, which subsequently lead to a long-standing disagreement between the two as to whether or not the Winged Boar Statues had, in fact, participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. Telling it Like it Is. Despite their hatred for each other, both McGonagall and Umbridge share the same patronus: a cat, although McGonagall's resembled her Animagus form.

She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students would need her in his absence. During said event, the latter was - to no one's surprise - placed in Slytherin House, as his ancestors before him. Upon learning this, Professor McGonagall alerted the Ministry of Magic, which sent an agent from the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to recover the all. Along on this endeavour was one of her former students and fellow Head of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, Constance Pickering, who kept commenting and asking questions about each of the artefacts as they were retrieved, much to the dismay of the Headmistress.
