[114]  He became infatuated with his slave-general Malik Kafur, who became the de facto ruler of the Sultanate after being promoted to the rank of viceroy (Na'ib).

[7], According to Amir Khusrau's poem Ashiqa, Karna and his queen Kamala Devi had a daughter named Devala Devi ("Dewal Di").

Meanwhile, the Khilji army had captured one of Rai Karan’s queens named Kamala Devi and forced her into Alauddin’s harem. The Delhi army did not seem to have suffered any serious reverses against the Guhilas, as they were able to easily capture Gujarat sometime later.

Two other rebel readers — Yalhaq and Burraq — sought shelter with the Vaghela king Karna. The mutineers were mostly "neo-Muslims", the Mongols (Mughals), who had converted to Islam recently. Alauddin was impressed by his profound learning and asceticism. Alauddin also eliminated the intermediary Hindu rural chiefs, and started collecting the kharaj directly from the cultivators. [7], On the third day after Karna fled his capital Anahilavada (modern Patan, called Nahrwala in Muslim chronicles), the invaders arrived in the city.

[97] In addition, Alauddin demanded four-fifth share of the spoils of war from his soldiers, instead of the traditional one-fifth share (khums). Just like the Islamic prophet Muhammad's four Rashidun caliphs helped spread Islam, Alauddin believed that he too had four Khans (Ulugh, Nusrat, Zafar and Alp), with whose help he could establish a new religion.

At the wealthy port city of Khambhat, Nusrat Khan he obtained a great amount of wealth from the local merchants and other rich people.

During the conquest of Gujarat, Nusrat Khan had committed a terrible slaughter and broke many significant temples. [18], Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan returned to Delhi with a huge amount of wealth and prisoners, including Malik Kafur and the Vaghela queen Kamala Devi. [63], The plunder obtained from Devagiri prompted Alauddin to plan an invasion of the other southern kingdoms, which had accumulated a huge amount of wealth, having been shielded from the foreign armies that had ransacked northern India. Even Bada'uni, who placed a high value on the historicity of Ashiqa, chose to ignore these claims in his writings. He left Devagiri with a huge amount of wealth, including precious metals, jewels, silk products, elephants, horses, and slaves. Deval Devi was born to Delhi and lived in the royal palace. Director. [13] As Alauddin marched to Delhi, the news spread in towns and villages that he was recruiting soldiers while distributing gold. He viewed their haughtiness and their direct and indirect resistance as the main difficulty affecting his reign.  [137], In 1296, Alauddin constructed the Hauz-i-Alai (later Hauz-i-Khas) water reservoir, which covered an area of 70 acres, and had a stone-masonry wall. He convinced Jalaluddin to visit Kara and meet Alauddin, saying that Alauddin would commit suicide out of guilt if the Sultan didn't pardon him personally. [146] Barani's claim that Alauddin thought of founding a religion has been repeated by several later chroniclers as well as later historians. [46] The Mongol invasion of 1303 was one of the most serious invasions of India, and prompted Alauddin to take several steps to prevent its repeat. [130] According to Barani, during the last four or five years of his life, Alauddin fell "deeply and madly in love" with Kafur, and handed over the administration to him. The victims allegedly hatched a conspiracy to overthrow Alauddin, but this might be Kafur's propaganda. Sultan Alauddin Khilji was not on good terms with his wife Mahru, who was mistreating him all the time. The period drama stars Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji, Hydari as his wife Kamala Devi, Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati and Shahid Kapoor as Rawal Ratan Singh. Royal commands belong to the king, legal decrees rest upon the judgment of the qazis and muftis. Alauddin's 30,000-strong cavalry, led by Malik Nayak, defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Amroha. Khizir Khan Khilji was eldest son of Allahuddin Khilji from his wife second wife Maharu. As a result, Jalaluddin appointed him as the new governor of Kara in 1291. [143], Ziauddin Barani, writing half-a-century after his death, mentions that Alauddin did not patronize the Muslim ulama, and that "his faith in Islam was firm like the faith of the illiterate and the ignorant". His vigorous and extensive conquests led to him being viewed as persecutor both at home and abroad, including by Maulana Shamsuddin Turk, Abdul Malik Isami and Wassaf. [118] Based on Barani's description, scholars Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai believe that Alauddin and Kafur were in a homosexual relationship. While fans are eagerly waiting to see the sizzling chemistry once again between Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in Padmavati, it is also a known fact that Alauddin Khilji … The same thing was repeated in 1980 by Prof K. S. Lal, who too absolved Alauddin Khilji of “trying to abduct Padmini Devi”. [123] She was captured by Khalji forces during an invasion, escorted to Delhi as part of the war booty, and taken into Alauddin's harem. [3], The army of Alaudeen on March to Deccan, a 20th-century artist's impression, While instigating Alauddin to revolt against Jalaluddin, Malik Chajju's supporters emphasized that he needed a lot of money to raise a large army and stage a successful coup: Malik Chajju's revolt had failed for want of resources. [128], Malik Kafur, an attractive eunuch slave captured during the Gujarat campaign,[129] caught the fancy of Alauddin. While an officer named Bhimadeva ("Bhim Deo") was escorting Devala to Shankaradeva, some Muslim soldiers visiting Ellora chanced upon his contingent. Alauddin Khalji was born as Ali Gurshasp in 1267 CE to Shihabuddin Mas'ud, brother of Jalaluddin Firuz Khalji. The inquiry was conducted by the orthodox ulama, who found several Ismailis guilty. Karna seems to have recaptured at least a part of his former territory in the later years. When Malika-i-Jahan heard that Jalaluddin's nobles had joined Alauddin, she apologized to Arkali and offered him the throne, requesting him to march from Multan to Delhi. The invaders ransacked Delhi and its neighbourhoods, but ultimately decided to retreat after being unable to breach Siri. Considering all these points, Isami's statement that Karna had to seek refuge from the Kakatiyas seems correct. Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the period drama features Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji while Aditi will play his wife, Kamala Devi. [69] Kafur started his march from Delhi in November 1310,[70] and crossed Deccan in early 1311, supported by Alauddin's tributaries Ramachandra and Prataparudra. [23] According to him, the practice of punishing wives and children for the crimes of men started with this incident in Delhi. This, combined with their general grievances against Alauddin, led to resentment among Mongols who had settled in India after converting to Islam. Badauni calls him Malik Manik. Alauddin sent a message to Karna, and Karna agreed to oblige. [130] He rose rapidly in Alauddin's service, mainly because of his proven ability as military commander and wise counsellor,[115] and eventually became the viceroy (Na'ib) of the Sultanate. After his death in 1316, Malik Kafur appointed Shihabuddin, son of Alauddin and his Hindu wife Jhatyapali, as a puppet monarch. [1] According to the Persian historian Wassaf (fl. [115][116], Alauddin removed several experienced administrators, abolished the office of wazir (prime minister), and even executed the minister Sharaf Qa'ini. The two generals later returned to Delhi with the wives and daughters of Karna. The Jain writer Jina Prabha Suri states that the Guhila king Samarasimha protected his territory from Alauddin's forces. Alauddin's 30,000-strong cavalry, led by Malik Nayak, defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Amroha. Now, Mirror has learnt that Aditi Rao Hydari has joined the stellar cast. Meanwhile, in Delhi, Jalaluddin's widow Malka-i-Jahan appointed her youngest son Qadr Khan as the new king with the title Ruknuddin Ibrahim, without consulting the nobles. Alauddin then entered the city, where a number of nobles and officials accepted his authority. Assuming this is correct, Alauddin's birth can be dated to 1266–1267. These officials were well-paid but were subject to severe punishment if found to be taking bribes. [48], In 1304, Alauddin appears to have ordered a second invasion of Gujarat, which resulted in the annexation of the Vaghela kingdom to the Delhi Sultanate. [156] Barani, while summing up his achievements, mentions that the submission and obedience of the Hindus during the last decade of his reign had become an established fact. [141], The construction of the Lal Mahal (Red Palace) sandstone building near Chausath Khamba has also been attributed to Alauddin, because its architecture and design is similar to that of the Alai Darwaza. [162] Kakkasuri in Nabhi-nandana-jinoddhara-prabandha mentions Alp Khan issuing a farman permitting the Jain merchant Samara Shah to renovate a damaged Shatrunjaya temple. [30] Like Isami, he does not mention Kamala Devi at all. [41] Alauddin managed to reach Delhi before the invaders, but did not have enough time to prepare for a strong defence. [120], Alauddin's wives included Jalaluddin's daughter, who held the title Malika-i-Jahan, and Alp Khan's sister Mahru. Despite objections from Khizr Khan's mother, the two later married. Some time later, in 1297 Kamala Devi married Ala-ud-din Khilji, the first recorded marriage between a Hindu princess and a Muslim ruler. She refused to … [32], Also, it is unlikely that the Yadava king Ramachandra granted refuge to Karna. [80] After facing the Mongol invasions and several rebellions, he implemented several reforms to be able to maintain a large army and to weaken those capable of organizing a revolt against him. He gives you space and encouragement," Aditi told [30], In 1299, the Chagatai ruler Duwa sent a Mongol force led by Qutlugh Khwaja to conquer Delhi. He rose to position of general in the army.KING Karan flied with his daughter Devaladevi but his wife Kamala Devi was seized by Alauddin Khalji’s general but on the way back to Delhi on reaching Jhalore the queen was released by Devda Rajput of Jhalore and King Karan’s general. The Jain poet Acharya Ramachandra Suri was also honored by him. [23], In the winter of 1297, the Mongols led by a noyan of the Chagatai Khanate raided Punjab, advancing as far as Kasur. At Kara, Jalaluddin's messengers learned of Alauddin's military strength and of his plans to dethrone the Sultan. Khusro calls him Malik Naib Barbek Izzud-daula. [93] By suppressing these chiefs, Alauddin projected himself as the protector of the weaker section of the rural society. He is noted for thwarting the Mongol invasions of India. Marriage alliances made between noble families had to be approved by the king. “Ranveer is amazing. [27] Isami does not mention Kamala Devi. "[155], Alauddin believed "that the Hindu will never be submissive and obedient to the Musalman unless he is reduced to abject poverty." However, historian Kishori Saran Lal dismisses this account as inaccurate. “Sanjay sir is … [10] The temple had earlier been destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century, but had since been re-built. Alauddin Khilji remained indifferent because of his bad health. The temple of Somnath was sacked. [27][28] During the army's return journey to Delhi, some of its Mongol soldiers staged an unsuccessful mutiny near Jalore, after the generals forcibly tried to extract a share of loot (khums) from them. Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the period drama features Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji while Aditi will play his wife, Kamala Devi. [51] The Delhi army conquered the fort, and the defending ruler Sitaladeva was killed in November 1308.

This gives enough ammunition to argument … Rani Padmavati – the wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh, is known for her beauty and valour in 13th century India. [4] The 15th century text Kanhadade Prabandha also states that the Vaghela king had humiliated Madhava, killed his brother Keshava, and abducted his wife. [16] He balanced the power between the officers appointed by the Mamluks, the ones appointed by Jalaluddin, and his own appointees. [5] To finance his plan to dethrone Jalaluddin, Alauddin decided to raid the neighbouring Hindu kingdoms. [138], Like his predecessors, Alauddin was a Sunni Muslim. During the last years of his life, Alauddin suffered from an illness, and became very distrustful of his officers. [4] Alauddin was not on good terms with his mother-in-law either, who wielded great influence over the Sultan. A. Desai notes that no such conclusion can be drawn from Isami's writings. Alauddin married Kamala Devi after converting her to Islam. Then Alauddin beheaded the emasculated Karan Deva. As she was led away, the queen had to abandon her infant daughter Devala Devi. It is five years after his marriage to Kamala, does Khilji come across the beautiful Rani Padmini. [2], Alauddin was brought up by Jalaluddin after Shihabuddin's death. In his poetic style, Khusrau states that by this time, all the insolent Hindus in the realm of Hind had died on the battlefield, and the other Hindus had bowed their heads before Alauddin. His slave-general Malik Kafur led multiple campaigns to the south of the Vindhyas, obtaining a considerable amount of wealth from Devagiri (1308), Warangal (1310) and Dwarasamudra (1311). Even wives and children of soldiers rebelling for greater war spoils were imprisoned. [13], At that time, there were heavy rains, and the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers were flooded. [20] In 1297,[21] the aristocrats (maliks), who had deserted Jalaluddin's family to join Alauddin, were arrested, blinded or killed. The individual soldiers in the Delhi army had also managed to gather their own loot. Over the next few years, Alauddin successfully fended off the Mongol invasions from the Chagatai Khanate, at Jaran-Manjur (1297–1298), Sivistan (1298), Kili (1299), Delhi (1303), and Amroha (1305). Kamala Devi was taken to the Harem of Alauddin Khilji where she was raped daily by the Sultan. [13] His objective was to cause a change in the general political opinion, by portraying himself as someone with huge public support. Only three maliks from Jalaluddin's time were spared: Malik Qutbuddin Alavi, Malik Nasiruddin Rana, Malik Amir Jamal Khalji. Sultan Allauddin had an eldest son, who was his heir and his name was Khizr Khan (Mahru’s son). Ranveer Singh aka Alauddin Khilji finds a wife, Aditi Rao Hydari. His government recruited many accountants, collectors and agents. [71], At this time, the Pandya kingdom was reeling under a war of succession between the two brothers Vira and Sundara, and taking advantage of this, the Hoysala king Ballala had invaded the Pandyan territory. [111], Alauddin banned prostitution, and ordered all existing prostitutes of Delhi to be married. [25] The Jain author Merutunga also states that he ruled up to 1304 CE. He also ordered "to supply some rules and regulations for grinding down the Hindus, and for depriving them of that wealth and property which fosters rebellion. .
