Types of Indicator: There are many types of indicators. Examples: - Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H2 SO4) , nitric acid (HNO3), carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ), b) Acid reacts with base to give salt and water. When a strong base reacts with a weak acid, the acid is unable to fully neutralize the base. Thus, acid or base is always added to water and water is never added to acid or base. Acids react with metal carbonates and metal hydrogen carbonates to give salt, water and carbon dioxide. Calcium hydroxide gives calcium carbonate and water when it reacts with carbon dioxide. In chemistry, a salt is an ionic compound which is made up of two groups of oppositely charged ions. Sodium chloride is also known as table salt or common salt. 4. (2) It is a mild,non-corrosive base. SALTS A salt is a compound formed when thehydrogen ions in an acid are replaced by metal ions or by ammonium ions. The term bleach means removal of colour. Test For Hydrogen Gas: The gas evolved after reaction of acid with metal can be tested by bringing a lighted candle near it. Methanoic acid (HCOOH) Bases: Bases are bitter in taste, have soapy touch, turn red litmus blue and give hydroxide ions (OH–) in aqueous solution. (1) It is a white crystal which are sparingly soluble in water. Sodium carbonate is formed after the reaction between sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and carbonic acid (a weak acid). 5 answers. Antacids like magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2] also known as milk of magnesia and sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda) are used to neutralize excess acid. Sodium hydroxide is used for degreasing of metals, manufacturing of paper, soap, detergents, artificial fibres, bleach, etc. The gas evolved because of reaction of the acid with metal carbonate or metal hydrogen carbonate turns lime water milky. (i) Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Calcium chloride (CaCl2) belongs to chloride family. For acidic solutions : pH < 7 Potassium Chloride (KCl): It is formed after the reaction between potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and hydrochloric acid (a strong acid). Burning with pop sound is the characteristic test for hydrogen gas. An acid is a substance which gives hydrogen ions or proton (H+) when dissolved in an aqueous solution. The salt formed by strong acids and weak base are strong salt. Posted by Subhaschandra Bc 2 hours ago. Baking soda is used in toothpaste which makes the teeth white and plaque free. Example: When sodium hydroxide (a base) reacts with hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide breaks into a sodium ion and hydroxide ion and hydrochloric acid breaks into hydrogen ion and chloride ion. The colour matching chart is supplied with a universal indicator which shows the different colours for different values of pH. pH Scale is the scale which shows the quantity of hydrogen ions in acid or base. Acid salt. H2SO4 + 2NaOH --> Na2SO4 + H2O complete replacement of Hydrogen ions. Question 5 List few […] They give hydroxyl ions when dissolved in water. Due to this, a neutral salt is formed. State the number of water molecules present in crystals of washing soda and plaster of paris. Lecture 1.1. (1) It is used as an antacid in medicine to remove acidity of the stomach. Acid + Base → Salt + Water During salt formation cation is coming from base and anion is coming from acid. The sodium carbonate, thus, produced, makes the taste bitter. When a concentrated solution of acid is diluted by mixing water, then the concentration of Hydrogen ions (H+) or hydronium ion (H3O–) per unit volume decreases. This shows that all acids contains hydrogen. Although, baking soda also produces carbon dioxide on heating, but it is not used in cooking because on heating, baking soda produces sodium carbonate along with carbon dioxide. The chemical name of baking soda is sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) or sodium bicarbonate. According to new CBSE Exam Pattern, MCQ Questions for Class 10 Science pdf Carries 20 Marks. Examples: Sodium hydroxide gives hydrogen gas and sodium zincate when reacts with zinc metal.

Class 10 Acid, Base and Salt Short Answer Questions. For example; sodium carbonate, sodium acetate, etc. Strong Acids Base + Non-metal oxide → Salt + Water This whole process is known as Chlor – Alkali process. (ii) Mineral Acids: Acids that are prepared from minerals are known as Mineral Acids Example; Inorganic acids, man-made acids or synthetic acid are also known as Mineral Acids. Example citric acid, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid. pH = -log [H3O+] … neutral. Alkali is considered a strong base. For example; Phenolphthalein, methyl orange, etc. Hydrogen gas and zinc chloride are formed when hydrochloric acid reacts with zinc metal. (i) Citric acid. Example: It is because H+ is unstable. Question 31. Salt formation may be considered as a way to alter the physicochemical properties of a compound without appreciably changing its chemical structure (although the regulatory bodies consider salt forms as distinct chemical species). HCl → H+ + Cl-. Example: Similarly, when potassium hydroxide is dissolved in water, it dissociates hydroxide ion and potassium ion. CBSE class 10 Science Chapter 2 Acids Bases and Salts notes in PDF are available for free download in myCBSEguide mobile app. Examples: (iii) Basic Salts: Salts which are formed after the reaction between a weak acid and strong base are called Basic Salts.
