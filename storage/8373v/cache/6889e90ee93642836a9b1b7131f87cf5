I dont mean to sound dramatic, but it really changed my life and how I feel about myself for the worst. Even if you have no experience whatsoever with the Arts, AAU doesn't judge. It’s excellent for part time learning. I only have myself to blame. Being able to attend college while working 50+ hours each week has been very daunting and has caused several sleepless nights. 4) I have recently taken a assistant instructor job and will embark this journey avoiding the potholes AAU caused to many. I had some health problems and found that if you fall behind, it can be really hard to catch back up but for the most part I had instructors that were understanding and willing to work with me. ", "Intro to Production Design, and Production Design 1-3 were useless, practically the same class each time, and by Production Design 3, the teacher was agog that none of us, presumably at least two years into the program by now, couldn’t price a stage flat. Woah! Although a different teaching style, and learning style, are required for online classes, I have had amazing luck and have learned a ton since starting two years ago. You definitely won't be able to complain that didn't prepare you for the professional world because they push you HARD. Predatory capitalism at its best. There was so much diversity in the other programs they offered and my education was broad with the 4 year B.A. The Academy of Art is acutely aware of the responsibility it has toward students, who are making an investment in their future and deserve every opportunity to … Thats a tried and tested tactic used in gambling ya know? If you spend time reading the reviews you will see that they are trying to promote their online class. That Saturday, my friend, who know of the situation checked for me ad sent me all these bad reviews of the school. This is a very expensive school, but some may justify that with an amazing employment rate after graduating (that is, *if* you graduate.) I would highly recommend any art student considering this university to enroll. I tried to assist photographers after I graduated and had no idea how to use the programs that are a standard in the industry. 32% of 89 students said this degree improved their career prospects, 29% of 89 students said they would recommend this school to others, "I guess everyone has a different view of this school but in my experience, I feel like it's been very good. , studied at Academy of Art University (2007) Answered 3 years ago It’s really good if you use everything they have to offer.

Then, they were asking $95 for the enrollment fee...ok? The total expected amount of $ was a little over $140,000. I was taken aback but I went through the process. Teachers are always in close contact with their students to answer any and all questions and are always seeking new ways to help their students improve. B.Arch The first professional degree 162 unit Bachelor of Architecture (B. I used to be someone who always had her nose in a sketchbook, you can't imagine how it feels to look at a blank page now and feel nothing but anxiety. One thing people would be aware of is that the classes can be really time consuming and there can be a lot of assignments in certain classes. Your frustrations should not deter young artists from pursuing these possibilities especially when FAFSA and other programs are there to help momentarily pay for a dream. Rating 4 out of 5. You can take a single drawing class and go … I can also afford the classes. For zoom, it's kind of bad but hey, what can we do about it, but it's not as fun as being there in class. I learned so much about myself as an artist that I did not know existed prior to this edcuation. The online courses offered at the university are a benchmark in education. And then the amount of help I am being given and the fact I am being contacted on a weekly basis to make sure I'm still certain about attending, and if I have any questions.

Just do a simple google search about this school's misconduct with predatory recruiting practices, improper real-state dealings, and a ridiculous private vintage car collection worth millions which is stored in campus buildings. I did some of my best work for myself here, and it was hacked apart constantly. ", "They take forever to respond to emails. The biggest thing to consider is the price of the school. Everything in their online class can be learnt from Youtube. Instead of preparing this student with the appropriate classes they just had them repeat the class until they passed. When you're hooked in, they will use the fact that you are on student loans which require you to maintain certain credit hours to meet the loan requirement, or if you drop below the minimum, you will have to start paying off the loan right away while in school. Ok, So the positive is that this University has great location, that's about it.Here is a sum of my experience at AAU. Even after telling them you are not coming back they still are incessantly calling. 1) Looking back I strongly feel misguided, Why ? I knew it was going to be hard, and I put 1000 percent in until the very end. Not even 2 seconds later, they were calling me and wanted to do all the paperwork to get me started for the spring semester. All of the teachers are incredibly respectful when critiquing your work but won't lie to you about what needs work. ". Deterioration began with my many different advisors. I kept seeing ads for this school and decided to apply. 259 reviews of Academy of Art University "This school is a mixed bag. AAU is that bad. This is all for the better and I would highly recommend for anyone that needs a flexible option for college to look into and apply at the Niche requires Javascript to work correctly. My advisor was very attentive and the teachers have been good and easy to understand, the classes are a little hard and you do have to put in a little extra to get good grades. It’s a for profit school that requires deep, deep pockets. this school is set to where I can see all of my assignments at the beginning of the week and then complete them by Sunday night. This school focuses on profit vs. a well educated student. These advisors know nothing about you nor do they record anything about you in your file. Some people enjoy teaching online and others do not. My art has definitely improved and some instructors are very very devoted to helping you learn! I wouldn’t wish this school on my worst enemy. Everything online said BA until they changed their online board 3 semesters showing in and showing that of the 112 units I submitted they took less than 35 and didnt tell me and I was not in my BA program. In fact they won’t allow students to take classes outside their set degree planner. If you have any soul for art, stay away. I am doing my full semester online and the platform is very well set up. The school is fast paced, and you will have to put in a lot of work like any other school. I've heard from other people they dealt with rude advisors and what not, other than that financial advisor, everyone was pretty nice. If you want a cheap and easy education, this isnt the school for you. They can see that you’re struggling but usually won’t comment unless you communicate clearly. Class discussions amount to nothing. DO NOT GO. In 2018 the library has reported 30,352 physical volumes, 3,785 physical media: Housing: Yes Academy of Art University provides on-campus housing. Nope. Good! all throughout high school, like myself. ", "I was beyond excited when I started classes here (online) and in the very beginning it went rather well. I really enjoyed mine as a game artist as there are professors who've worked in the industry. I told my advisor everything I was feeling and how I felt like I was teaching myself for thousands of dollars. The instructors don’t help unless you explicitly state your problems. You will spend tens of thousands, get in a lifetime of debt, and never get a job that can pay it off. They even sent over the materials list within a matter of minutes and all supplies were linked and easy to purchase. The expectations of your teachers and the amount of work is overwhelming at times. ", "I really enjoyed my time studying at AAU, the instructors where amazing, I attended from 2014-2019 and only had 3 instructors that I didnt care for. Some of the teachers really know their stuff... but some... think the "B" in "RGB" stands for black. Remember, non-refundable. I learned a lot and really finely honed some skills during the first couple years. The app gets low ratings because it’s so bad. ", "Its a scam. This app is designed for their online class. ", "They will lead you on a wild goose chase selecting courses or telling you what to take which is not even close to what you are focusing on in the first place. IMO this is not the way to educate. It will take much longer to graduate than they let on in the beginning. mostly you will stick with rude and who doesn't care. I prefer being on-site for the social aspects of class but their online portal has made the transition to online school during the pandemic a lot smoother than most universities. ", "This place is a scam. Now im 30k in debt. Student Life at the Academy Academy of Art University is an absolutely amazing place to be a college student. Thank you for taking the time to post. Academy of Art University is a proprietary institution that was founded in 1929. Don’t go here! The majority of instructors have been helpful, especially in the foundational classes. I am an online student at the Academy of Art University. But I’ve attended schools with similar instructors. I can't deny there are many good professors but they leave. ", "Reading these reviews, I am thoroughly surprised with the experiences these people have had. The local advertising community won’t even hire people from here, even if you’re good. I ignored all the red flags: ads everywhere, no portfolio needed, calls constantly, and pay lots of $$$.  Disability services is the only helpful department. I have had several top-notch professors that truly care about my education and making me a great student. AAU is horrendously expensive and definitely considers profit their number one priority. Thats just my thoughts on it. If you're working with the current Illustrator version, this course will be of no value to you. My department there is one person who basically needs to be wooed in order to even get considered for an interview with companies visiting the University. As I was speaking to my financial advisor, he wanted me to sign the financial aid form so they can begin processing my loan ASAP. I have a master’s degree and nothing to show for it. No one else knows what they’re doing and the instructors don’t have educational degrees, and many of them are bigoted. Im so glad that some people have had good experiences, but most dont. Fight for what is right for you in terms of classes and if you are a transfer student like me, you have to be on top of what exactly transferred and make sure they don't have you take a class you've already taken at your previous university before.

The Academy of Art University (AAU), formerly Academy of Art College and Richard Stephens Academy of Art, is a private for-profit art school in San Francisco, California, in the United States. The Academy has grown to over 18,000 students & is the largest accredited private art & design university in the nation. The information is easy to learn and the setup is easy to learn. As an early … Academy of Art University will be hosting an exclusive online webinar to help you answer that very question. Ever wonder what it is like to take art & design classes online? Academy of Art University wants applicants that are also good ambassadors for the school - they want students who will give back to the local community and broader San Francisco area in general. From the moment I saw the campus and visited the city of San Francisco I was hooked. I don't think anything replaces in person learning; however, I've enjoyed the flexibility and quality of the education I am receiving online. In a field where portfolio matters more than a degree, you don’t have to attend art school if you have the self discipline to learn. ", "Awful school. THIS IS A 100%-ACCEPTANCE-RATE SCHOOL, there is no pride in graduating from this school. I’m attending because of the 100% enrollment (I started with no portfolio and no art experience) and because it offers online classes, which work for me since I have chronic health issues. Then after I struggled there, they put me in the class that would have prepped me for the one I struggled in. I haven't yet been a part of the school because this will be my first year attending but so far everything has been good. I learned and grew so so much. They provide videos and directions on how to use the platform. Programs no one in the photo industry uses. B Spend your summer doing something that speaks to your values, personal growth, leadership qualities and other less quantifiable characteristics. Are there better schools? I haven't drawn in over a year now. For those saying the school is a money scam...all colleges and universities are in some sense a endless "money bag black hole" (welcome to America). Instructors have admitted to having different expectations for each student so it’s impossible to look to your peers work to help you judge your own work. Although my classes are at my own pace, they also offer weekly on-time Zoom classes where you can personally interact with peers and professors. This is all for the better and I would highly recommend for anyone that needs a flexible option for college to look into and apply at the Academy of Art University. At my portfolio review to qualify for graduation, the guy barely looked at my small binder, said it was “good enough,” spent way more time discussing portfolios with the male students in the room than any of the girls, and told me I could not use my elective credits left to take further demo reel courses for the purpose of adding to my portfolio before graduation because “those classes are just for directors and screen writers, they’re not for you.” I second everything I’ve read here about the school failing to properly prepaid students for life after graduation, as it’s been six years since I earned my degree, and I’m still getting nowhere. The number one complaint I see normally has to do with finances, it is a for profit school and it costs a lot, but shouldnt you already be aware of the financial burden before attending? We’d love to hear your suggestions. It's very obvious that a lot of time was spent organizing the curriculum and degree progress because things start to fit together like a big puzzle as you advance through the courses. Back in 2019, I applied here. due to the amount of knowledge i had to painstakingly learn after graduation with the shame of not being able to learn even design fundamentals while enrolled. I had a mental breakdown after working on my final for a painting class and called the very next morning and dropped out after a couple years of giving it my all. A few of the teachers are good but too many of them simply don’t teach and tell you are bad if you ask questions. The instructors are phenomenal and did a wonderful job during the Covid-19 crisis to keep me engaged. In fact, one student I know re-took a studio class SIX TIMES (= $18,000)!!!! They didn't advise me on what classes to take so I just took to the course list and winged it. All in all, if I can succeed in steering you away from wasting your time and money at AAU by sharing my experience I hope it helps you to not get caught in the trap I was caught in. I do take all of my classes online and I like it better. Glassdoor has 597 Academy of Art University reviews submitted anonymously by Academy of Art University employees. books, medium etc.) I would rather go to community college. Sadly, not every student is prepared or ready when they enroll in the school. Yeah. I was conned out of money. It’s a way to steal money. In addition the grading system for the school as a whole is insane. 3) There are few part time instructors who I can call proudly my mentors, but the full time staff is pathetic and did not follow any structure and took the semester timeline for granted while giving more importance in imposing authority than they should have made the course more engaging to the students. 2) Post graduation career services are nightmare, At least my department, I cannot speak for all departments. ", "RIP OFF ! I was in shock and immediately cancelled the process. He prob didn’t care much about my situation as he was only temporary. I was actually exited because I really wanted to go back to school and study Fine Arts. ", "5 years have past since graduation, Now I can reflect on my education with a clear vantage point. Arch.)
