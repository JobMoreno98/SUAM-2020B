Scientists at U.S. Jessica Kennelly. Since their reintroduction to the Pacific coast in the 1970s, the sea otters' rapid recovery and voracious appetite for tasty shellfish such as urchins, clams and crabs has brought them into conflict with coastal communities and fishers, who rely on the same valuable fisheries for food and income.

A sea otter swimming in nearshore waters of Kachemak Bay. “The kelp are gone, and it just looks like a desert.” This repopulation has had various direct and indirect impacts on local ecosystems. For the analysis, researchers integrated local ecological field studies with available economic data and a recent tourism study, and accounted for uncertainties in future values and potential interactions among the species in the coastal ecosystem. But, the researchers warn, the costs and benefits of such large ecosystem reorganizations are often not equally distributed. One of the best things you can do to help sea otters is to work to reduce your personal reliance on … The abundance of food also meant the local sea otter population increased from about 270 otters to about 432 after 2014.
