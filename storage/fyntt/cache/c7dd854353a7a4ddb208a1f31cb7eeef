Keep these things in mind and you'll look this happy about working with inequalities. Here’s a chart to cover all the inequality symbols: Less than—the number on the left is less than the number on the right; 2 < 3, Greater than—the number on the left is greater than the number on the right; 3 > 2, Less than or equal to—the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right; 2 or 3 ≤ 3, Greater than or equal to—the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right; 2 or 3 ≥ 2, Does not equal—the number on the left does not equal the number on the right; 2 ≠ 3.                         partner: "uarus31"                    { bidder: 'onemobile', params: { dcn: '8a969411017171829a5c82bb4deb000b', pos: '8a9694390178783c4ccf416425e10264' }}, Usually, it's on the same key as the period on U.S. keyboards. Once you do this, you will be better acquainted with the greater than meaning, greater than symbol, and greater than or equal to symbol in the concept of Greater than.

John 13:16 Parallel Verses [⇓ See commentary ⇓] John 13:16, NIV: "Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him."                     params: { This guide will help walk you through what a rational number is and what they look like.                    { bidder: 'openx', params: { unit: '539971080', delDomain: 'idm-d.openx.net' }},             dfpSlots['houseslot_b'] = googletag.defineSlot('/2863368/houseslot', [], 'ad_houseslot_b').defineSizeMapping(mapping_houseslot_b).setTargeting('sri', '0').setTargeting('vp', 'btm').setTargeting('hp', 'center').setCategoryExclusion('house').addService(googletag.pubads()); Hence the name; “inequality” means that two things are not equal.                    { bidder: 'ix', params: { siteId: '195451', size: [300, 50] }},                    { bidder: 'criteo', params: { networkId: 7100, publisherSubId: 'cdo_rightslot' }},         var pbDesktopSlots = [                    { bidder: 'onemobile', params: { dcn: '8a9690ab01717182962182bb50ce0007', pos: '8a9694390178783c4ccf416436a60266' }},                    { bidder: 'onemobile', params: { dcn: '8a969411017171829a5c82bb4deb000b', pos: '8a9699e70178783c43f941643ca4022f' }},               'max': 30,                                                  Therefore, it implies that either five or six are greater or equal to two. A p-value higher than one would mean a probability greater than 100% and this can't occur.
