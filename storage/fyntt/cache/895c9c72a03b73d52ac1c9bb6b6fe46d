Parasitic Plants Holoparasites (lack chlorophyll) – Rafflesia (biggest flower) Hemiparasites (photosynthesize) – Mistletoe Microparasites – reproduce inside host Bacteria, viruses Macroparasites – release juvenile outside E.g. General properties of parasitic plants• Nutrients and water are transported via a physiological bridge, called the haustorium. The multiple independent origins of plant parasitism suggest that numerous ancestral plant lineages possessed the developmental flexibility to meet the requirements of a parasitic life style, including such adaptations as the ability to recognize host plants, form an invasive haustorium, and regulate the transfer of nutrients and other molecules between two different plants. Another aspect is to impede perennial weed dispersal (or parasitic weeds) through the opportune use of treatments and tillage and the use of drainage tillage to prevent propagation of some species that need high moisture levels. ), India 26 11.
