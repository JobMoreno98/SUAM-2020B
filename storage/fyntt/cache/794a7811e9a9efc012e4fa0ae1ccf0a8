S. Barrow, [1] In 1315 parliament removed Marjorie's right as heir to her father in favour of her uncle, Edward Bruce. [15] The Bruce resistance to Balliol may have been verging on collapse in 1335 but a turn-round in its fortunes began with the appearance of Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell as a potent war leader at the Battle of Culblean. By her he had at least ten children: By his second wife, Euphemia, daughter of Hugh de Ross, 4th Earl of Ross, and widow of the 3rd Earl of Moray, formerly his colleague as regent, he had five children: The confusion about the circumstances of his first marriage would later lead to conflict amongst the descendants of his first marriage (which included James I of Scotland) and the unquestionably legitimate descendants of his second marriage. They had the following children: Has Children John STEWART King Robert III Of Scots b: 1337 in Scotland. [81] The weakening of government if anything, Lynch suggests, came not before the 1384 coup but after it, despite the fact that the coup had at its root Robert II's favouring of his third son, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan (known as the Wolf of Badenoch).[82]. Walter the Steward had died earlier on 9 April 1327,[9] and the orphaned eleven-year-old Robert was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Sir James Stewart of Durrisdeer,[2] who along with Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, and William Lindsey, Archdeacon of St Andrews were appointed as joint Guardians of the kingdom. [35] The reasons for the incident remain unclear but may have involved a dispute regarding Robert's right of succession,[36] or may have been directed against George Dunbar, Earl of March and the southern Justiciar, Robert Erskine. He was the only child of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and his first wife Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce and Isabella of Mar. Robert, Earl of Fife and from 1398 Duke of Albany (died 1420), married in 1361 Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith, and his second wife in 1381 Muriella Keith (died in 1449). In 1363 he rose in rebellion, and after having made his submission was seized and imprisoned together with four of his sons, being only released a short time before David's death in February 1371. [S658] The Royal Stewarts, Henderson, T. F., (William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London, 1914), 929.241 St49h., Stewart Pedigree. Robert II toured the north-east of the kingdom in late January 1390 perhaps to reinforce the changed political scene in the north following Buchan´s removal from authority. [78] Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons. [11] Robert set about winning back his lands in the west of Scotland. Robert II, also called (until 1371) Robert the Steward, or (1357–71) Robert Stewart, Earl of Strathearn,  (born March 2, 1316—died  April 19, 1390, Dundonald, Ayrshire, Scot. When Robert II came to the throne, a fourteen-year truce with England still had twelve years to run, although unofficial warfare with England continued along the border. He was also known as Robert, High Steward of Scots and by his Gaelic Name, Roibert II Stiùbhairt. Contents  [show]  Heir presumptive[edit] Robert Stewart, born in 1316, was the only child of Walter Stewart, High Steward of Scotland and King Robert I's daughter Marjorie Bruce, who died probably in 1317 following a riding accident. Robert may have concluded that as the French had reneged on a previous agreement to send assistance in 1383 and then having entered into a truce with England, that any military action would have been met with retaliation and exclusion from the forthcoming Boulogne peace talks. Fictional portrayals[edit] Robert II has been depicted in historical novels. It seems that Strathbogie may also have persuaded Robert to submit to Edward and Balliol—Sir Thomas Gray, in his Scalacronica claimed that he had actually done so—and may explain his removal as Guardian around this time. Robert II toured the north-east of the kingdom in late January 1390, perhaps to reinforce the changed political scene in the north following Buchan's removal from authority. By 1354 ongoing negotiations for the king's release reached the stage where a proposal of a straight ransom payment of 90,000 marks to be repaid over nine years, guaranteed by the provision of 20 high-ranking hostages, was agreed—this understanding was destroyed by Robert when he bound the Scots to a French action against the English in 1355. The king died at Dundonald in 1390, and was buried at Scone. Illegitimate children of Robert II and Mariota de Cardney. Egidia, who married in 1387 William Douglas of Nithsdale. [68] Modern historians show a kingdom that had become wealthier and more stable particularly during the first decade of his rule. Son of Walter, Steward of Scotland and Marjory Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce. The tale takes place in the reign of Robert II whose "country enjoyed happiness and peace, all save a part adjoining to the borders of England." Partner of Isabella Boucellier?
