I wanted to understand my rebellion. The man responsible for the actual economic crisis reveals himself as an anarchist. What can I do to destroy them? The foolish anarchist who throws bombs and shoots people knows that he is killing people, while also knowing that his doctrines do not include the death penalty. The following day, capital would be in the hands of others and, through them, it would continue its tyranny. One man is born a count or a marquis and thus enjoys the respect of everyone, whatever he does. Until then, the social fictions could only be shaken, left hanging by a thread; they would only be destroyed with the coming of a free society and the definitive fall of bourgeois society. Napoleon and his military despotism. The conversation had been gradually petering out for some time and now lay defunct between us. — A sudden, overwhelming social revolution that would force society to leap from a bourgeois regime to a free society, a social revolution prepared for by intense and continuous work, by direct and indirect action, intended to prepare all minds for the coming of a free society and to lull bourgeois resistance into a state of coma. Fernando Pessoa. Were they capable of argument or thought, that is the argument that would be used by the fools who defend a dictatorship of the proletariat.

He took it up again shortly afterwards, his voice calmer. Indeed, that is what we must strive to combat and destroy. — I do, yes. “I was always pretty clear-thinking. In theory, you’re an anarchist, but in practice... — I’m as much an anarchist in practice as I am in theory. You’re basing yourself on the arguments I’ve just given you; you think that I found anarchism impracticable and decided, as I said before, that bourgeois society is the only defensible and just society. I therefore had to apply to practical life the fundamental process of anarchist action which I have already explained—combating social fictions without creating a new tyranny, and, if possible, creating a foretaste of a future freedom. StephanEwald #MAGA on Twitter: "quotes "The Anarchist Banker quotes "The Anarchist Banker" from Fernando Pessoa. I decided that the anarchist ideal was above such squabbles. I freed myself. What I mean is that, between my theories and how I lead my life, there is no divergence at all, but absolute conformity. But in that case, what have they to do with a free society, or with freedom? That’s what I’m coming to. It couldn’t be anything else. If you go to war, you both win and lose. February 16, 2020 [PDF] [EPUB] The Anarchist Banker Download by Fernando Pessoa.

It’s true that one or two of the more intelligent among them were a little shaken by my exposition, not because they didn’t agree with me, but because they had never seen things so clearly, nor been made aware of the complexities of the issues. So what? Do you perhaps doubt that my social theories are different to theirs? Just kidding.. It was impossible to determine this in any satisfactory way, that is, in any rigourously logical or scientific way. And so it goes on, in all aspects of life. I became a conscious and convinced anarchist, the same conscious and convinced anarchist I am today. There had to be another way, a way that would involve fighting, not fleeing. Something that is natural is entirely natural, not half-natural, or a quarter, or an eighth. We can’t all be equal before Nature: some are born tall, some short; some are born strong, some weak; some are born more intelligent, others less so. My motto as an anarchist was ‘freedom’, so fine, I have freedom, the kind of freedom that our imperfect society allows one to have. None of this had an impact on any particularly serious matter; there were no serious matters they could affect. — I’ve already told you that I am using the word ‘anarchism’ in its proper sense. Only my awareness of having done my duty, of doing something for a worthy end, and neither of those things could be termed a selfish reward; neither of those things is a pleasure in itself. He helped organize the Anarchist Federation of America in 1908 and was arrested several times for a variety of offenses connected with anarchist activity. The difficulties were as follows: it is not natural to work for anything, whatever it is, without receiving a natural, that is, selfish reward for it; and it is not natural to put all that effort into something without having the reward of knowing that your aim will be achieved. Those who started giving orders to others, or leading them into areas where they didn’t want to go, were not doing this based on their having money or social position or some entirely fictitious authority they might have arrogated to themselves; they were doing it under the influence of something that went beyond those social fictions. Now you see, the tyranny we had created amongst ourselves was not like that; the tyranny we had created was exercised over men like ourselves, our natural comrades, over men who were our comrades twice over because they shared the same ideal. It’s very simple. In short: they are pseudo-anarchists and I am an anarchist. I tried out this conclusion, or rather conclusions, on my comrades and they agreed with me; they all agreed that it was necessary to go forward and to do everything possible to create a free society. Which is the most natural fiction? It might be of interest, especially certain aspects of it, but it’s not really relevant to the matter under discussion. He suddenly smiled like someone who has reached an important juncture in his argument; he looked at me hard and then went on, speaking more clearly, more emphatically. The Anarchist Banker And Other Portuguese Stories. The interviewer seems to be out of arguments. If society can be natural, then it’s possible to create an anarchist or free society, as is only right, because an anarchist society is entirely natural. No one wanted to follow me along the true anarchist path, so I would walk it alone, with my own resources, with my own faith, without even the moral support of those who had once been my comrades in order to do battle with the social fictions. What would be the result? You’re simply accusing me of not being more than one person. Get Full eBook File name "Anarchist_Banker_-_Fernando_Pessoa.pdf .epub" Format Complete Free. The destruction of social fictions can contribute to the creation of freedom or to preparing the road for freedom, just as it can contribute to establishing new social fictions which are equally bad because they are equally fictitious. I have to choose one of two courses of action, the only two open to me; obviously I can’t choose both. I’ve never helped anyone, because that implies a diminution of someone else’s freedom; it’s against my principles. — I certainly do. They might merely want to play at being libertarians, but I did not. Within that inevitable fictitiousness, we make it as natural as possible in order that it can be as just as possible. I said, “You really are an anarchist, but even after hearing what you say, I still can’t help laughing when I compare you and your fellow anarchists out there. These anarchist achievements, before be- He wants to be free from the influence and pressure of social fictions; he wants to be as free as he was when he was born, which is how it should be; and he wants that freedom for himself and for everyone. — And is the theory you believe in today the same as you believed in then? For example, the tyranny of helpfulness. If I had become a banker and a businessman for the reasons you think, I would not be an anarchist, I would be bourgeois. If that is not possible, then neither is anarchism; and if anarchism is impossible then, as I’ve just proved, the only defensible, fair society is bourgeois society. I was sure about one thing, though: they had to be destroyed in a way that would benefit the cause of freedom and with a view to the future creation of a free society. Even more important, how do you make war at all? For someone who has only this one life, who doesn’t believe in eternal life, who admits no other law than that of Nature, who is opposed to the State because it is unnatural, to marriage because it is unnatural, to money because it is unnatural, to all such social fictions because they are unnatural, why on Earth should he defend altruism and sacrifice himself for humanity if altruism and self-sacrifice are also unnatural? What I don’t quite see is how... — I’ll explain. To give up a pleasure, simply to give it up, is not natural; to give up one pleasure for another is. We would all work towards the great social revolution, we would work for a free society, whether the future justified our efforts or not. — The tyranny of helpfulness. And it has always been like that. I’ll work alone in order not to create, in any conceivable form, any kind of tyranny. I succeeded. Isn’t that it? “That’s all very well, but there’s something you’ve missed out. Would the social fictions be in any way shaken? If we don’t think like that, then we are not freethinkers at all; we are merely bourgeois. “And that was what I did!” He immediately withdrew the gesture and went on. I’ve already told you what those reasons are, and you have understood them. But was the idea of duty natural? What is the natural use of our natural qualities? Why don’t you criticize those who haven’t done so? What would happen if you destroyed all the capitalists in the world, but kept Capital? Someone who gives orders to another for reasons that have nothing to do with the established social fictions must do so because he is superior to the other in one or another of those natural qualities. In 1910 and 1911, he helped organize and run the Ferrer School in New York. They, the people in the trade unions, the ones who throw bombs (I did the same once until I emerged from that into my true anarchism), they are the detritus of anarchism, the whores of the great libertarian doctrine. If we believe that social fictions are unjust because they crush and oppress what is natural in Man, why put all our efforts into replacing them with new fictions, if instead we can put all our efforts into destroying them? I was and I am. The argument is absurd, though, because, as I’ve already said, the tyranny which I should not have created, and which I did not create, is something else entirely. I haven’t changed in that respect; I still am an anarchist. Let’s examine that aspect of the problem. Obviously, by propaganda, I don’t just mean the written and spoken word. He didn’t even light his cigar, which had again gone out. Let us return to the case in point. If you destroyed Capital but not the capitalists, how many capitalists would remain? The idea that inspired the revolutionaries, the aims they espoused, have vanished completely from the social reality which is now occupied exclusively by a warrior mentality. There would then be something in material existence to which humanity could adapt itself. Besides, this is all in reply to a question that you asked me. — And don’t you find it logical? I don’t think I’m particularly vain, but if I am, at least I’m not vain about qualities I don’t have. 216.Misc Anarchy 217.Combo Locks II 218.Misc Anarchy II 219.Thermite IV. In what way are you an anarchist? But this, apart from the obvious difficulties involved, would not be combating a social fiction; it would not be combating anything, it would be running away. I argued the question out with myself. I accept—I have no option but to do so—that a man might be superior to me because Nature gave him more talent, strength, or energy; what I cannot accept is that he is my superior by virtue of artificial qualities, qualities he did not have when he left his mother’s womb, but which he had the good fortune to be given as soon as he was born: wealth, social position, an easy life, etc. Now imagine a much larger, much more influential group, dealing with important matters and decisions of a fundamental nature. And even if I were merely sent to prison or into exile, the anarchist cause would have lost a fighter for the cause, whereas the twelve capitalists I had disposed of would not be a loss to bourgeois society because the component parts of bourgeois society are not fighters, they are purely passive elements, for the ‘struggle’ lies not with the members of bourgeois society but with the social fictions upon which that society is founded. The degree of intelligence or willpower of an individual is down to him and Nature; the social fictions themselves contribute nothing. — Come on!

And where did that perversion come from? — But how could that be if, right from the start, I’ve told you again and again that I remain an anarchist, that I not only was an anarchist but I still am? The Anarchist Banker by Fernando Pessoa The story of The Anarchist Banker takes place in a Lisbon café where the narrator meets an old friend, now a wealthy banker. You mean that there’s no difference between you and the men who throw bombs and form trade unions? I do what I want, within limits of course. In that case, what was the point of all my self-sacrifice? Do you want me to believe that your life is identical to that of those people ordinarily termed ‘anarchists’? Opposite me sat my friend, the bankera well-known capitalist and tycoonabsent-mindedly smoking his cigar. How could I shrug off its influence and tyranny over me without avoiding contact with it? Are you saying that there’s no conflict between your true anarchistic theories and the life you lead, your present life? I have realized the limited dream of a practical, clear-thinking anarchist. — My whole life proves it. Having got that far, the banker paused for a little longer than usual. I tried to revive it with an idea that had just surfaced in my mind. You cannot use reason to deal with this problem because it is a historical or scientific problem and depends on knowing the facts. Where did that idea of duty come from? I have already established that a social fiction can only be destroyed by social revolution and dragged along with the other social fictions in the fall of bourgeois society. Immediately after that, pursuing the same line of thought, another difficulty arose which also caused me considerable problems. What more could I do? I am a materialist, I would think to myself. What I could do was to work as hard as I possibly could to prepare for that revolution. The book has been awarded with , and many others. From that springs his rebellion against the social conventions that make that inequality possible. As a sequestrator, as a banker, as an unscrupulous financier—forgive me, but you yourself used such terms—you created tyranny. — As I was saying, in the area of material adaptation there is still one further hypothesis. He questions his friend about his anarchist origins and discovers to his amazement that the banker still considers himself to be an anarchist. What I did have was a sharp intellect and a strong will. Smiling, I turned to him and said, “I know what I’ve been meaning to ask you. How can I collaborate alone in preparing for the social revolution, in preparing humanity for a free society? I laid hold of sticks and stones. They were unmasked. Because my course of action—which, as I proved to you before, was the only true anarchist course of action—did not allow me to free anyone else. I gave all that a lot of thought. I needed to work and struggle for the cause of the oppressed and the victims of social conventions. (You understand, don’t you? Aim: an anarchist society, a free society. It too goes against anarchist principles. Article PDF Available. I couldn’t do that either, for the same reasons. I was the one combating it; if I were to render it powerless over everyone, that would not be subjugating it but destroying it, because that would be putting an end once and for all to the fiction of money. If I understand you correctly, you’re saying that you’re different from them because you are more of an anarchist than they are, is that so? The Anarchist Banker. I resolved that difficulty via the same sentimental process by which I resolved the other problem, but I warn you that, just as with the first problem, when I reached a full understanding of what anarchism meant to me, the solution I found then was both logical and automatic, as you will see later on. I almost decided to have nothing more to do with it all. The main characters of this fiction, philosophy story are , . What I want to say is that there is no divergence between my theories and the conduct of my life, rather there is an absolute conformity. In the end, though, they agreed. There’s no need for me to tell you about my commercial and banking life. NATIONAL-ANARCHISM: READER is perhaps no different, in that it represents a new attempt ... to educate and inspire a new generation of disaffected young radicals. That was just one small example; there were other singular instances, some minor, some major. And you see, apart from demonstrating that this anarchist course of action is the only true one, the very fact that it automatically resolves all the logical difficulties that might oppose an anarchist course of action is still further proof. Working for the future is all very well, I thought; working so that others should be free is only right. I almost lost my faith in anarchism. It wasn’t a tyranny that derived from a social fiction which, however regrettable, would be understandable up to a certain point, although less so amongst people like us engaged in fighting those fictions. That tyranny is the tyranny intrinsic to all social fictions and I could not, nor did I try to, destroy any social fictions. For the whole of humanity. — That’s a good one!

The one wanting to go to the left, however, would say to the other: ‘Why don’t you come with me?’; the other would reply quite truthfully: ‘I can’t; I have to go this way for this or that reason.’ In the end, though, contrary to his will and his convenience, he would accompany the other man and turn left instead. It required not intelligence, but action. — They rejected it, my friend, they all rejected it—some more vehemently than others, but they all protested, That simply isn’t how things are! All I needed were my ideals. The course of action itself prevented me doing more than that. The conditions of your course of action were, as you yourself proved, not only to create freedom but also to not create tyranny. Why should I bother about consciousness-raising and social inequality and other such things when I could be enjoying myself and having much more fun than I would have worrying about all that? As I told you, I encountered a difficulty and, for good or ill, I resolved it. That would have fitted in with your feelings of rebellion. Some drifted into being the boss, others into being the subordinate. And I ended up leaving. Published in 1922 the book become immediate popular and critical acclaim in fiction, philosophy books. And, as I said, I’ve never thought of myself as an orator or a writer. — It is. Unless, of course, you’re not using the word in its... — In its proper sense? I am neither an orator nor a writer. Smoking is not natural, it is not an instinctive need—but, if we get used to smoking, it becomes natural to us, it comes to feel like an instinctive need.). What emerged from the French Revolution? We need have no qualms about crushing the ‘freedom’ of the powerful, of the well-to-do, of all those who represent the social fictions and benefit from them. For my part, everything I read confirmed me in these opinions. If society cannot be natural, if (for some reason we needn’t bother with here) it cannot be other than fictitious, then we simply make the best of a bad job. — That decision hardly reveals tremendous intelligence on your part. Notice, too, that it occurred in a group of people who had gathered together in order to do what they could for the anarchist cause, that is, to do what they could to combat social fictions and to create a future freedom. His course of action is foolish because, as I’ve already shown, in anarchist terms, that course of action is wrong-headed and counter-productive; as far as the morality of that course of action is concerned, however, it is intelligent. They could be different things, and they would be just as bad because they would still be fictions, because they would superimpose themselves on, and mask, natural realities. No fiction is natural in itself, because it is a fiction; in our case, the most natural would be the one that seems the most natural, that feels the most natural. Action is always more productive than consciousness-raising, except for people who are natural propagandists: the great orators, capable of electrifying crowds and getting people to follow them, or the great writers, capable of fascinating and convincing with their books.
