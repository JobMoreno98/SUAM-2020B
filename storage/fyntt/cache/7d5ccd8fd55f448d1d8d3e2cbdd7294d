Yet I would argue the narrator is the real man of the crowd as he picks up on little details, paying close attention to each one individually before most likely moving onto the next. If I were an old man living in nineteenth century London, and noticed a man following me, I would be uneasy, and perhaps would wander around the city until he stopped. “The Tell Tale Heart” narrator says, “disease had sharpened my senses.” In both cases, the narrators associate illness (assumedly mental illness) with the acquisition of some special ability, creativity, or access to some higher knowledge or truth. The Man of the Crowd by Edgar Allan Poe "Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir tre seul," ~Geoffroy de La Bruyre. A third shot downs the elephant. The first question that need to be answered is who is the man of the crowd? The symbolic meaning of the mockingjay changes throughout The Hunger Gamestrilogy. A new aesthetic experience for Victorian novel writers was the city. Think of this character (in this extremely symbolic, un-realistic short story) as a symbolic figure.

It is the symbol of death too, as Michalis describes the car that kills Myrtle as a green light, though, it is a yellow car.The green light thus represents the false status of dream and hope that win nothing for Gatsby. "paragraph 6 - The narrator describes the junior clerks as "young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips. In terms of madness, the narrator never quite openly states that he is mad, but rather alludes to it in puzzling statements such as "I had been ill in health...the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition...I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain." Normally, when one discusses descending into something, they talk about descending into madness because one starts at normalcy and then goes down to madness. The second question is what is the relationship between this man and the crowd? Everyone has first impressions of people based on their appearance, but this man claimed to know their history with just a glance. Unlike any of the others surrounding him, he stops for no communication to any person nor persons. The crowd (motif) The large crowd appears and reappears in the essay, looming over Orwell as he self-consciously faces the elephant and prepares to shoot it. Those who are washed in the blood of the lamb, their robes turn white. "The Man of the Crowd" is set in London on a foggy night, which quickly turns into rain. His calling is hers. The quote that we find more relatable to the old man for most of the story is the German quote, “er lasst sich nicht lesen” which translates to, “it does not permit itself to be read.” Throughout the story, the narrator stalks the old man, who seemingly has no aim, and wanders throughout London with no purpose. Sitting by the window of a coffee house in London, the narrator observes the many types of people that travel down the street.  The old man of the story represents the uncanny. The uncanny is all about the "unhomely": that which is unfamiliar and strange. Perhaps it’s not as blunt as Emily Dickinson’s poem, but it’s got some of the same ideas. Another facet of the narrator's madness comes from his obsession with the strange old man. The man whom the narrator killed symbolizes the futility of war and the needless loss of life and potential on both sides of any conflict. Literary analysis of this story indicated that theme focused on the narrator who recovered from sickness and spend most of his time observing people around him, describing and categorizing based on their actions and mode of dressing. The two most-recognized international LGBT symbols are the pink triangle and the rainbow flag It was well said of a certain German book that "er lasst sich nicht lesen"--it does not permit itself to be read. It is eerily reminiscent of the narrator in "The Tell-Tale Heart," who was obsessed with his neighbor's eye and ended up killing him because of it. inability to identify that the strangest, scariest thing is what lies within us. By the dim light of an accidental lamp...The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation" (1839-1840). THE MAN OF THE CROWD. He is the man of the crowd. After a bit of time, the elephant sinks to its knees and begins to drool. So little does life consist in possessions that all the abundance cannot keep the breath in a man for one moment. What was really interesting was the progression of darkness and his obsession and fascination of watching the lives of strangers. IT WAS well said of a certain German book that “er lasst sich nicht lesen”- it does not permit itself to be read. While sitting in the cafe, the man notes to himself, "As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness of avarice, of coldness, of malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense, of supreme despair." The narrator of “The Man of the Crowd” claims to have a more normal skill, which is why he doesn’t appear mad at first. The crowd doesn't reflect a physical threat, however, so much as the threat of delegitimization and humiliation. The very first lines of Poe’s “The Man of the Crowd” imply that this is a secretive story by nature, for Poe suggests that this particular narrative may not “permit itself to be read” (p.1561).

The story itself takes on a responsibility independent of that of the author, for it is the story itself that must compel a reader to find reason in its foundation. What does the narrator do when police reinforcements arrive? By observing, examining, and analyzing what he sees, he is capable of identifying the people’s position in the society, occupation, and even nationality. the narrators disturbed mind has created this game in which the narrator is trapped in and is unaware he is in. it is as if there is no clear divide between this man he is following and himself.
