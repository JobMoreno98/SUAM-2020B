These profiles are drawn to illustrate the gradient of the stream. regional joint or fracture pattern of the bedrock. In either case, sea water rises farther up onto land than it did before. The longitudinal profile of a stream is a plot of the elevation of the stream channel at all points along its course and illustrates the location of the three zones. kinetic energy of the water is expended to move sediment particles, time, Final cut through Assessment of longitudinal profile gives significant amount of information regarding past climate, river discharge and sediment load, tectonic control of an area (Leopold et al. All this will be related to the geology, slope, water discharge, the size of sediments, the quantity of sediment load, the velocity of flow, etc. In a long section, elevations are determined along a fixed route.
