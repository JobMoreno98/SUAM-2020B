Includes benefit to public health through medicinal uses. It is in the family Orobanchaceae.Some species are serious pathogens of cereal crops, with the greatest effects being in savanna agriculture in Africa. salve, compounds valued by ethnic groups). Medicinal uses: Family specific links: Scrophulariaceae in Southern Africa. curative medicines are produced from the taxon). in Burkina Faso. Witchweed was first detected in the western hemisphere in a corn field in Columbus County, North Carolina, in July, 1956. Provides minor medicinal benefit (e.g. Plants are normally 15.2-30.5 cm tall but some have be recorded to grow 61 cm. 3 = Moderate health benefit. Table 1 con­ tains a list of synonyms, the geographical range, and some hosts of Striga species. tall, branching from above the middle, densely hispid, square in cross section. 5 = High health benefit. Many other names were subsequently applied to different variants in different regions, including S. hirsuta by Bentham in 1846. One species, S. gesneroides , has very different host range from the other witchweeds; it uses a … 0 = No health benefit. We found that about 98% of the plants- and possibly all the plants- have powerful medicinal qualities, and many are used as food in the countries of their origin. Striga asiatica is an obligate parasite (it cannot develop independently from a suitable host). 2.3 Description and Biology of Striga asiatica.  Asian Journal of Crop Science 2010 , 2 (3) , 147-154. Striga asiatica has a much wider range that includes much of Africa, parts of India, China, and Australia. Linnaeus first described this species as Buchnera asiatica based on material from the Comoros Islands near Madagascar.Loureiro separated Striga from Buchnera in 1790 and applied the name S. lutea to yellow-flowered specimens collected in India. In addition, Striga asiatica was accidentally introduced into North America in the 1950s. Plants are normally 15.2-30.5 cm tall but some have be recorded to grow 61 cm. We at VIFarms did a research on the traditional medicinal and culinary uses of these plants, which are being exterminated in the US at a great cost. The seeds are quite cold-tolerant, able to withstand prolonged storage at -7 °C. Unlike Striga, Orobanche plants lack chlorophyll and are fleshy with scale-like leaves and less colorful flowers. Medicinal plants have been used for many centuries not only in rural areas but also increasingly by urban citizens in both developing and developed countries [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 80% of populations worldwide depend on herbal medicine for their healthcare needs, especially in rural areas []. Striga asiatica is an annual obligate hemi-parasite of monocotyledonous plants. It reproduces by seed, producing tens of thousands of minute seeds per plant. 1990. 1 = Limited health benefit.
