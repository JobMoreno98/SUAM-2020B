When film is pushed, contrast is increased, saturation is increased, grain is increased, and color shifts can occur. But when making that decision, the first concern I had was how I was going to cope without my quite-recently found love for this fast and … Although not many people actually refer to it as such, when you "push" film in development it is because you "pulled" the exposure when shooting the film. I'll be sharing all the reasons why I overexpose film or shoot box speed. 2) When you’re developing film. Color film’s latitude is huge… like 2 to 3 stops for underexposure and up to 6 stops for over-exposure (depending on the film stock). the ISO on the box). When the film is developed, Pushed film is left longer in the developer and Pulled film shorter, compensating for the different ISO setting, underexposing or overexposing film. You expose the skin tone right up on the shoulder of the film, give a low contrast look to the skin tones it also diffuse a bit of detail and softens the skin a little. I would never up/downrate slide film, it just never looks good. In the video, Jay uses Fuji Pro 400H, Kodak Portra 400 and Kodak Portra 800.  I’m also going to use the term “box speed” here: Shooting at Box Speed means that you use the official manufacturer ISO for the film (ie. Overexposing film means that you let more light than recommended hit the film. Get started on your creative journey with the best in creative education taught by world-class instructors. Lower ISO numbers are less sensitive while higher ISO numbers are more sensitive. While it’s difficult to give advice […] I can count on one hand how many times I’ve ever pulled film and with this film being 100ASA, I don’t see it ever happening here. Pushing film means that you underexpose it, but also develop it for a longer time, to compensate for the underexposure. I’m going to follow it up with a couple of posts explaing why you might choose one of the other of these for colour or B&W film. Your film sensitivity remains the same. So it could be the only roll in the tanks. My photos will all be blurry.”. Privacy Policy. The development time is already quite short, and the process often results in a flat, murky look. Light is what makes a photograph work and a proper exposure is required to make a good photograph. Pushing the film might produce a small amount of detail in the areas that were lightly dusted with the sand (the shadows), but not by much. What’s a Good Alternative to Kodak Ektar? A lot of people new to film get confused at the difference between overexposure/underexposure and pushing/pulling film. All film was developed normally, with no push or pull processing. Their LCD screen was small which didn’t help with analysing shots and they were consistently getting back to their PC to find that they’d overexposed shots. Why? Two things determine the brightness/darkness of the image: how much sand hit the square, and how long it is in the developer. What’s in the Unicolor C-41 Kit and What Size Should You Buy? Most labs that develop Black & White film will do the next part for you. If you're pulling a film you're overexposing and compensating that by a shorter developing time. As a film produced to be sold in some hot and humid regions, Pro Image 100 is said to stand up well to high temperatures, albeit to the slight detriment of the results it gives when compared to other Kodak Professional films. “Pushing” and “pulling” are terms you’ll often hear in the film photography world. So you give the film more light and make up for it when you develop it. If your camera doesn’t have an ISO dial but does have an exposure compensation setting (which is often marked as EV+/-), you can set that to -2.00. Color negative film, however, has a lot of latitude in terms of exposure, and many photogs will overexpose their film to help increase the color saturation and light. Spot Buy Film Canada in Mike Janik’s Latest Vlog, A Nice Review of Bergger Pancro 400 on Youtube, The Economics and Quirks of Pro-Packs vs. You may need a faster exposure for shots with moving subjects, or in low light situations in order to keep your shutter speed from being impossibly low. Pulling film in processing is similar to pushing, but with the reverse effects. Sign In. It is used when film is overexposed and would benefit from less contrast. This is understandable, because the terms refer to very similar things, with one main difference. I’ve tried to keep this post brief and basic, and just explain what the difference between these two terms is. It does not matter if you're using film or digital media; the concept is the same.      in The figures you see with the images (-1 Stop, +1 Stop, etc.) Your images will have more contrast when you push the film, and will also be more grainy. If you push or pull however, your photos should look mostly the same as shooting at box speed, but the amount of contrast and grain will be a bit different (I’ll explain that later). So, why would anyone want to underexpose while shooting? So, a 400 ISO film pulled a stop (-1) is then being rated at 200 ISO. Remember me Not recommended on shared computers. The reason one would push/pull is if you under/overexposed your film either intentionally or unintentionally. … So basically, when you use the terms pushing and pulling, the key difference is that the actual development process is different than normal. In practice, pushing B&W film is much more common than pulling.                     All                    Film, © Richard Photo Lab. I don't think you'll like the results. When you push your film during shooting (“underexposing” is the more common term for pushing film in-camera; but, we also really need you to know what this is before we get to pushing in development, so we are going to frame it this way), you’re setting your camera to have a higher ISO rate than the film. This is usually done with underexposed film. In some places there is more sand, and in some places there is less sand. There are a couple of trade-offs however. What up guys! For black & white film, overexposing is a somewhat uncommon practice, but can be helpful when shooting subjects or environments with high contrast, to decrease the range of values. Even though the film is being pulled in-camera, the film is developed normally (we’ll tell you why in the next section). When pushing or pulling film in processing, it’s important to note that the most noticeable effects will be seen in the increase or decrease of contrast in the image, not an increase or decrease of effective exposure. When you overexpose, or underexpose film, but don’t compensate for it while developing, you’ll get photos that look brighter, or darker than if you shot at normal box speed. How much longer depends on how many stops you pushed the film by, and what film and developer you’re using. This is 2 stops higher than the box speed, so you can use a much faster shutter speed. Pulling film is effectively the opposite. If you push a film you are underexposing a film and compensating that by extended developing time. Pulling film is just the opposite of pushing and is much less commonly used. Before we talk about pushing/pulling during shooting, you need to know what ISO is. So, Richard Photo Lab is breaking down exactly what it all means in our ultimate guide to pushing and pulling photographic film! In order to understand pushing/pulling film during development, let’s start with a little visualization exercise to illustrate the chemical process of developing film. Enjoy!www.instagram.com/gboniiwww.instagram.com/rasheedingram shooting (“underexposing” is the more common term for pushing film in-camera), you’re setting your camera to have a higher ISO rate than the film. Pulling film is essentially rating film lower (slower) than its intended ISO speed, for instance pulling a 400 ISO film to 200 to slow exposure by one stop and overexposing the film. This isn’t the case with B&W film, because all the different types already have different developing times, so labs don’t really stick these in big machines, they tend to use a more manual process. That sand represents the light that hit the film. All you have to do is to trick your camera into thinking your roll of film is a higher ISO, perhaps ISO 1600. You’re telling your camera that the film is less sensitive to light than it is, thus exposing the film to more light. Drop a handful of sand onto the square. RJGee the idea for overexposing 3 stops is that it changes the look of the film. Why? Underexposure vs Overexposure – A Beginner’s Guide. Underexposing film means that you change your settings so that less light than recommended hits the film. Is Developing C-41 (Colour) Film Really Harder than Black and White? Sign in with Facebook Join Sandra Coan for Lesson 3: Film Vs. Digital Camera Sensor of Introduction to Film Photography on CreativeLive. Push and pull processing refers to under/overexposure followed by relevant over/under development, something I recommend reading dedicated articles on. Pushing and pulling are done by changing the temperature of the developer, or by adjusting the time the film is left in the developer. Once your film is developed, you will now magically have a bunch of photos that look like they were exposed at box speed, even though you didn’t have enough light to do so. Kodak Portra 800 is quite possibly my favourite colour negative film. Probably the most time that you hear about pushing or pulling is when people talk about pushing Black & White film. If you choose to push or pull a roll of film, you have to commit for the entire roll. Whether you hope to flatter the skin of your subject or simply love the look of creamy tones, you can achieve beautiful results by overexposing your color film. Pulling film means that you overexpose it, but also develop it for a shorter time to compensate. So the next time you chat with your photog friends, or with the lab, keep in mind the differences between pushing and pulling 1) during shooting (under/overexposure) vs 2) during processing. This speeds up the exposures, thus exposing your film to less light. They should be linked below once I write them. ISO is a system of measuring a type of film’s speed, which indicates that film’s sensitivity to light. That said, I did once put through a roll at 400ASA in one of my F2s and didn’t much care for the results. A reader sent me an email this week telling me that they were having a few issues with exposure levels in their shots. Usually, one would want to push process film that was underexposed. So now, once you’ve tricked your camera into thinking you’re shooting ISO 1600 film, you go about your business and shoot the film. Watch a free lesson today. "Pushing" ISO 100 film to ISO 400 means you underexpose by two stops when shooting the film and then "push" the development to compensate. Pushing increases grain and contrast and is far more common than pulling. When you underexpose your film during shooting, it will usually need to be in the chemical developer for longer in order to compensate—we'll talk more on that later. The “P” in P3200 actually stands for “push”—that’s right, this stock was intended to be pushed in film processing (ie, developed longer) when shot at 3200, because its nominal ISO is 800. Imagine a frame of film as an empty square. Let’s go back to our visualization exercise: if an area in the square was not hit by the sand at all, leaving it in the developer for longer won’t change the fact that it wasn’t hit by sand. Pulling film is mostly done to reduce contrast in high contrast environments. When you develop film, you are developing the areas on the square that were hit by sand. refer to stops of underexposure or overexposure achieved ‘in camera’. So your camera will take longer exposures, the film will spend less time in the developer (whether you or the lab is developing it), and your photos will have less contrast and grain. Interesting to consider and difficult to put into practice. But because so many photographers’ relationships with the medium stem from a digital photography world, the topic is oftentimes misunderstood. Ah… Push, pull or shoot normally. However you have speed enhanced developers like: Diafine, microphen, DD-X where you can reach 1 1/2 F stop above nominal iso rate. Unlike digital where when you change your ISO, you actually change the sensitivity of the sensor; in film, when you change your ISO you only change the way your meter reads the light. A common way to trick your camera is to set the ISO dial to 1600. I say that as someone who’s just committed to shooting only P3200 and Ektachrome E100 for at least 6 months in a bid to learn these two returned-to-market films from Kodak properly. Instead of overexposing the film, you can push it in development, and especially with extremely old film, you may want to use a combination of overexposure and push processing. Available with seamless streaming across your devices. Brighter negatives are better than darker Posted Let us say that you have a Generally speaking, the slower the film speed, the more contrast a film has and a film like Panatomic X, for example, needs processing very carefully to avoid excessive contrast, and so it responds badly to push processing. Remember: When you are intending to push film in processing, make sure that you are metering for the medium to darker areas of the image in order to preserve details in the shadows. Pushing film means that you underexpose it, but also develop it for a longer time, to compensate for the underexposure. You just have to tell them “Please push process this, I shot it at 2 stops above box speed, ISO 1600”, or something like that – it’s probably extra smart to marker this onto the actual film canister too. When you set your camera to have a lower ISO rate than your film, you are pulling your film during shooting (“overexposing” is the more common term for pulling film in-camera; but again, we also really need you to know what this is before we get to pulling in development, so we are going to frame it this way). It gets the film to give the soft pastel look. It’s allowing the film to spend less time in the developer thereby lessening its contrast and muting its colors. For each stop, you double your shutter speed, so you can now take pictures at 1/60s (four times faster than 1/15s). Pull Film. “Oh no!” you think, “I know from experience I can’t hold my camera steady for a fifteenth of a second. Full information on the metering technique used is at the bottom of this article. Pushing or pulling colour film is entirely possible, but not as common either. Though the original stock (Kodak 500T 5219) is recommended to be rated at EI 500 in tungsten light, many cinematographers and filmmakers regularly rate this film at 1000 speed with no push, due to this film's amazing shadow latitude, but the ideal ISO/EI to rate this film at will always be somewhere between 400 and 800 without push processing. But (and this is where a lot of photogs get into trouble) it results in scans that have muddy/grainy shadow areas. The areas that were hit by sand get brighter the longer they are in the developer. This is not necessarily a bad thing, depending on what you’re looking for, and some people will push film just to get this effect. Pushing your film is the solution to this situation! When you load your camera with film, you will indicate an ISO rate for your film. Knowing how to obtain a correct exposure is not the only reason why you need to know the difference between overexposed photos and underexposure photos. When you pull a film by a stop you are halving the speed of the film. Forgot your password? This video I go over the differences between overexposing/underexposing and pushing/pulling film. Pushing/Pulling. Single Rolls, Buying C-41 Colour Film Developing Kits in Canada, Nico’s Photo News is One of the Best Youtube Film Photography Shows, “Saviour” by Floor Staff is an incredible video made from 1692 shots of expired Fujicolor 200, Kentmere 400 Black and White Negative Film (35mm Roll Film, 36 Exposures), Foma Fomapan 100 Classic Black and White Negative Film (35mm Roll Film, 36 Exposures), Kentmere 100 Black and White Negative Film (35mm Roll Film, 36 Exposures), Kodak Professional Portra 400 Color Negative Film (120 Roll Film), Where to Get Film Developed in Canada in 2018. All Rights Reserved. And on that topic, despite the name and the category it’s in, not much about this film felt very professional to me. This is why pushing film in processing isn’t a way to “save” underexposed film as much as an artistic tool in your bag of photog tricks. Now when you go to develop it, you are going to cut that time, so it won’t be too dense. Photography, by definition, is the process of capturing images with light. By Romanas Naryškin 54 Comments ... camera, subject, angle, time, composition, light, settings, color or black and white, film or digital, exposure is a creative choice that you make to help achieve a particular goal. When you pull film you are overexposing the film. If you develop film yourself, you will just need to leave the film in the developer solution for longer than normal. You check your camera’s meter, and it says that if you shoot at box speed (which is ISO 400 for HP5), your shutter speed will be 1/15 seconds. You can email us at support@buyfilm.ca if you need to get in touch. But many beginners have trouble with underexposure vs overexposure and what to do with these. There are two times in the practice of film photography that pushing/pulling film comes into play: The cost of 'pushing' film (at least in my lab) used to be about a dollar, and we did it by turning off the motor drive for 30 seconds (I think). So if my film is Portra 400, I would rate it at 800 and tell the lab to push it one stop in development. Pushing film (raising the effective ISO) typically increases contrast and the appearance of grain, while pulling film (overexposing and dialing down the effective ISO) generally lowers contrast and grain. By pulling the film, we are decreasing contrast and grain in our photos. 1) When you’re shooting film, and I still plan to write a couple of posts about doing this with colour film though, so if they’re not linked below, they should be soon! To overexpose your film, I recommend two easy techniques: 1. One reason may be that photo labs tend to develop colour film in large, automated machines, and they don’t have the flexibility to leave some film in the machine for longer than everything else. Overexposing film means that you let more light than recommended hit the film. Pulling film, as you may have guessed,  works basically in the same way, except you’re adjusting everything in the opposite direction. Finally, some cameras have neither of these options, and just read the film’s ISO directly from the DX Code on the canister (a simple bar code), in which case you need to learn about DX Code hacking (a whole other topic). The push film tends to gain contrast and grain onto the negative. I hope this explains the difference between these 2 things decently, and I guess I sort of veered into explaining the whole concept of pushing and pulling.
