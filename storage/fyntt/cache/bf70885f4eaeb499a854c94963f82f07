"[36] Kapoor received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work in the film. It was a moderate critical and commercial success. Recalling the glorious days of the past brings back tons of memories. [76] As of 2016, her eight films have grossed with making more than ₹1 billion (US$14 million).[55]. She and her sister Kareena were raised by their mother, who worked several jobs to raise them, until she made her debut in films as an actress. In the picture, Karisma had posed for the camera with her arms around her cute baby sister, Kareena, who had looked like a goofball with those chubby cheeks. In the picture, we could see, little Karisma sticking her tongue out while her daddy was seen posing for the lens. Sharing a candid picture with her grandfather, in which she was cuddled in his arms as he talked to her, Karisma had captioned it as “So many learning’s from my Dadaji… remembering you on ur birthday… #grandpalove #legend.”, (Also Read: Kangana Ranaut Net Worth: From Luxury Bungalows, Clothing Line, To Her Elite Collection Of Supercars), When her baby sister, Kareena had turned 40 on September 21, 2020, Karisma Kapoor had wished her with a cute throwback picture. While growing up, Kapoor regularly attended award ceremonies and accompanied by her parents to film sets. [64] Her beauty and performances have made her a style icon. Kapoor supports her close friend Salman Khan's charitable trust Being Human Foundation. In the early 2000s, Kapoor won the Best Actress and Best Actress Critics awards at Filmfare for her titular roles in the dramas Fiza (2000) and Zubeidaa (2001). [58] As of March 2020, Kapoor has finished working on the web-series Mentalhood for ALTBalaji. [1] At the age of seventeen, Kapoor left her studies to pursue a film career, making her acting debut headlining the musical film Prem Qaidi (1991).
