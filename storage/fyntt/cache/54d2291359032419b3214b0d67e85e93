This genre-bending series puts a modern twist on Greek and Roman mythology, exploring themes of gender politics, power and life … Dracula is a film series of horror films from Universal Pictures based on the novel Dracula written by Bram Stoker in 1897 and its 1927 play adaptation. In keeping with Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel , but not most film and television lore, vampires could walk in sunlight but lacked their powers. From Raven: “The highlight of the episode is when Dracula says he has MTV piped into his castle because he loves Young MC and later on name-drops Milli Vanilli.” Dracula: The Series made it to 21 episodes before its cancellation in 1991. . 1. The atmospheric fantasy series Penny Dreadful, about a group of uniquely skilled individuals hunting supernatural creatures in Victorian London, featured several famous horror legends of literature.Dr. | Full season and episodes - free online streaming fast high quality legal movies and TV television shows Created by Cole Haddon. Bram Stoker's masterpiece is brought back to life in this tale of a vampire posing as an American entrepreneur while seeking revenge.  The cheesiness is there on purpose, when it shows up in a number of eps, but the dialogue throughout is always fun and clever. Dracula: The Series is the tale of Maximilian (please, just Max)Townsend (played by Jacob Tierney) and his family and their quest to destroy the evil Count Dracula who is living… um, unliving as an extremely wealthy modern businessman in the heart of central Europe. The Count Dracula legend transforms with new tales that flesh out the vampire's gory crimes -- and bring his vulnerability into the light. However, his plan is complicated when he falls in love with a woman who seems to be a reincarnation of his dead wife. Goofy, pulpy fun that sets up the rest of this '70s series. This was my 15 minutes of fame, back in 1990. The series formula was relatively straightforward, with the four heroes learning of some plot by Lucard/Dracula and attempting to foil it, with at least some success. With Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Jessica De Gouw, Thomas Kretschmann, Victoria Smurfit. I play the teen girl leaving the nightclub with German Actor/Singer Andreas Zaron. Posing as Dr. Sweet, he befriended Ms. Vanessa Ives, a clairvoyant in Sir Malcolm’s employ. The Dracula legend has been redone a hundred times over and in 1990 the Prince of Darkness returned to us in Dracula: The Series. The premise: Dracula is a hell of a lot older than we imagine and constantly reanimated through the ages with the help of his familiar. This is as wild as Wolfman's Tomb of Dracula (published by Marvel around the same time) and even has its own wheelchair-bound protagonist.
