He described the actor as a fat and bald man with a “black bag and jacket”, matching Kim’s description on the day of his death. [107][108], On 16 March, Interpol issued a red notice for the four North Korean suspects who had fled to Pyongyang. While the details of the case alone make this an edge-of-your-seat viewing experience, White beautifully layers it with the bigger issues of society's treatment of women, immigrants, and of those in power who will sell anybody out to remain in office.

[23], Following Malaysia's refusal to release the body immediately, North Korea's ambassador Kang Chol accused Malaysia of collaborating with the country's enemies over the assassination of Kim Jong-nam. Hương's defence lawyers felt the Malaysian government was practicing discrimination in the judiciary system since the court previously stated that it found a prima facie case against both suspects but only released one.
