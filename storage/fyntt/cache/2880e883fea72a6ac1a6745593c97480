I don’t think I’ve ever visited Aberdovey without a visit to The Penhelig Arms, if only for a pint.This time I scratched it off our list of places to eat and drink during our week long visit.I appreciate that staff need to remind customers to wear a face mask but...there are ways of doing that without making the custom feel unwelcome.I came in the pub entrance inadvertently lowering my mask to ask if they were taking reservation for dinner- I was then asked to put on my mask and berated for having come in an exit door.When I asked how i was to know it was an exit the barmen responded in an extremely superior and dismissive manner telling me there was a big sign outside.Due to his unwelcome tone, not what he said, I suggested we should leave the reservation to which he replied that’s fine, turned away from me making no effort to redress the situation.Interested to see how I missed the ‘big sign’ I went outside to checkThere was in deed a big sigh that says EXIT ONLY to the right of the doors which as I came from the left would not have been on my radar.Suggest the bar staff are sent on some customer service training - this is a difficult time for everyone and trade is limited so losing a customer is, I’m sure, not on your agenda.How about changing the Exit Only sign to No Entry and put it ‘on’ the door so folk can’t miss it.
