Complex partial seizures are now preferably called "focal impaired awareness seizure" or "focal onset impaired awareness seizure." The left and right frontal lobes of the brain are large regions at the front of the brain that extends back towards the middle of the brain, accounting for approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the cerebral cortex.
